Looks ok. Not like so durable. Will hv to use a while to recommend others of its worth.
"Tried, the current can be very powerful depending on the setting, i don't dare to go higher but if go higher sure muscle will become sore and can see the effect faster."
"Item received after a week. Looks smaller than expected, can’t wait to try!"

Bought the full set. Received as described. Have to note that you need to buy additional gel pads as the pre-stuck gel pads will only last you approximately 1 week.
Items received... all items looks very small compared to pictures in the ad listing. 
Very good product. 
Item well received.. Thank you..
"Do not like the fit so much, very different material as compared to other design in the same brand "
"order received in 7 days! my second purchase for this design :-) absolutely love the quality material and fitting of this, and this purple color is gorgeous! size M fits perfect for a usual Nike sports bra S/M."
"Received the product fast and it’s Super comfy! Quality is good, even though it’s for exercising but it can be wear out as a simple top :)    *Photo is slightly filtered but the colors are true to seller’s picture "
Soft not bad
Thanks to the review by the ladies. Got M for me which is the sport size of S to M.  Good fit. Love the purple color. 
Order took abt 10 days to reach me. I usually wear S for tops so this fits well but the straps are a lil tight as I have pretty broad shoulders. Also bit difficult to put on and take off. Maybe I’ll try M next. Love the material.
Well received 
"Item received few days ago, abdominal left and right parts not working (vibration). Feedback to the seller but no result given. "
Great product and customer service. Will purchase from this seller. 
"Items received well packed. Delivery is quite fast, received within 1 week after order. Yet to try it. Hopefully it work well and show some result. :)"
Box damage when received

"The band looks great, tried the resistance and it feels good. Hope to use it soon"

Great porduct. Delivert quite fast
"Received in good quality, i like the colours!  "
Fast delivery works well
Receives the items in good condition and they are packed nicely in good packaging. This item is good to use and this is my 2nd purchase and recommend to purchase........................
"Product received in good quality , tried using it for the first time. Wow the intensity is really power. By using 20 mins on my arms and abdominals. I start to sweat already. Thanks for the wonderful product. Hope after using for 2 Months can see some results. "
Dint get the gel pad tho the rest as described 
Great works well
Thank u
"i like the length of the tank top, nicely cropped but not too short. the cup inside was a little too thick for my liking but the material is rly good for this price! "
"Though the paddings are rather thick, item came in good quality and for the price I paid for, it was a good buy! "
Love the Low back cutting. 
Item well received. Have yet to try. Hope it’s nice. Thank u!
Cutest top ever
"The padding is big, but not an issue as it can be swapped out. Otherwise, love the cut, especially the back!"
Looks pretty good. Feels thick as well. Yet to wear. 
Love this just that the bottom area is kinda loose ( it has an always lift at the back )
"Fabric is pretty thick. It’s good for yoga but higher impact exercises, not really. "
Gr8 but awkward lift at the back 
Brand on tag and bag is not MP like my previous purchases but good material 
Loving the backless sports bra! Feels like I can wear it on it's own or with another backless crop top! A little bit tight for my size but still able to fit. 
"The purple looks a bit darker in real life. Still happy, thanks!"
"Ordered on 15th June, received on 23rd June. 4th time purchasing and it is always a pleasant experience. Selected the wrong size and seller was helpful to amend my order. Satisfied thou would have preferred if the inside do not have a separated band. I suppose it gives more support that way anyway."
"received in 8 days! usually a Nike sports bra size S/M, I opted M for this based on the measurements provided, and it fits nicely! love that the white color material is good and thick enough, so it is not see through :-)"
"Repeated buyer, fits so well and so cheap when bought during flash deal, thank you!!"
"Second time buying from moving peach. This time not 100% satisfied with all items. I like the cutting for this. Fit is fine too, just that it comes with weird thick padding and is not so stretchy. I don’t like work out tops that are a struggle to remove. "
"Well received! Material is good, thick, stretchy, and opaque! "
Quick delivery and item looks exactly like photos. Great quality at such a low price. I would suggest sticking to your usual sizing as L is way larger than any of the other tops.
Material feels good! Items are exact to the pictures ~ yet to try on though  :) thanks!:) 
Love it niw using it
Received the product within 7 days. Box was dented but product seems ok. Have yet to try it. Thanks to the seller.
The product delivered as expected... It's good but just want to know how to get the gel.
Fast delivery and good quality. It's really working well. It makes me sweat a lot. What makes me more contented is that ..once you on it...it will not shocked you. It's slowly working and u can choose how the level. I love it the most among all I tried. Thanks seller I highly recommend you. God bless
As advertised. Sturdy and worth the money. 
Received in good condition. Yet to try to see if it works

Great item
Order received. Box was destroyed but item inside still nicely packed. Tried and could feel the contractions 
"Good product, really can feel a little sweaty. I have used for three days, still starting from Low to high current. However, right side stronger than left, so abs may turn out lopsided. Other than that, I think must also control diet and workout. This is just an additional measure"
as it had stated.
"Intensity is very strong. Only downside is the arm band is very short and can't cover the entire arm and may come off during use. Otherwise,  is a good value purchase"
Received item yesterday.. tested the device and it is working great.. just that it’s a bit flimsy.. 
Very well packaged and the size is just nice. Worth the money! 
"Product is great. However, delivery man left at the door without informing. "

Seller was very prompt in updating on the product delivery. Tried and works perfectly well. 
"Product received earlier than anticipated, the shopee status was indicating in transit. Size a lot different than expected.  Box was crushed on arrival. Have yet to try out but hope it works.The arm strips looks very small and short. Seller is responsive. One of the unit not working. "
"Shipment took longer than expected. But it is becos of the covid19 situation, so i can undrrstand."
Received in time. Seems to work ok however cannot feel any pulse from the additional wrap around sections that are attached to the main abdominal pad section. Aside from that works as described. 
Looks good! 
Fast delivery

Good condition
"I had recieved the goods, is well package and the controller is working. Thanks"
received well
Works very well
Product did not take too long to arrive. Tested and working perfectly as can feel the reaction on the muscles.
Received thru letterbox. Tested and can definitely feel something specially on high level. Not sure if it can accomplish what it claims but will find out soon enough. Adhesive gels would probably lose stickiness after a while though. 
It works !! 
Yet to open. Just collected. So far experience dealing with seller is good
Received well with the pads! Wrapped up properly too. Charging the controllers to see if they work but overall satisfied with this purchase.
"Pretty good, easy to use. Hope it will be effective and useful."

Item received in good condition
Fast delivery. 
Ordered this only a few days ago - fast! Item came nicely wrapped. Looks good. Looking forward to use it. 
Bright and nice orange colour. Fast delivery. 
"Received in good condition, thank you seller for the prompt delivery  "
Delivery was fast and worth it for the price! Material is a little hard so it helps with back ache and soreness. Overall good quality and prompt delivery! 
Fast delivery! The foam roller is hard and of good quality. Highly recommended 
My second purchase. Good quality and value for money. Fast delivery too. 
Delivery was fast
Package in good condition. Have yet to try it but im excited.
Box are dented oh why.
good buy during flash deal. 
"Looks cute & all but back part rides up like some others said, although sizing was right."
The padding was thicker than those from other products and fitting around bust could be better 
Love the back of the design!!! 
"The paddings are too thick and do not mold well especially on white colour, shoulder straps are a bit short, yet underarm hems gap a little... "
a good fit and quality material! it is also very comfortable though the cloth is on a thicker side
Fast delivery Received as what shown.. but the bra site doesnt fit well on me.. maybe I don’t have big boobs
Received in 9 days. Quality is good & comfy. 
"Will got another type, well fitted."
"Ordered 22nd of November, received on the 16th of June. Very satisfied with the top. "
Shipping is fast once it reaches SG
"Material is nice and soft, has a built in bra compartment. I like it a lot! "
"Quite thick, feels like swimwear "
Very good material. Comfortable and sizing is as described. Stretchable. 
Good quality.. Thumb up 
"Tank top came with removable bra padding, it was on the thicker side and weights a little so I swapped it out. Other than being a low - medium intensity bra tank, this too could easily be a lounge wear/ basic top. "
Major love the scoop back top plus the inner padding! 
NIce bareback cutting! Could even pair it with nice pants or skirt to head out. Material is thick and sticks nicely to the body when working out. 
"Like this very much .167/51kg, M fits me well ! "
"M is too big for UK6/8, would suggest getting S instead! So sad it feels so comfy but too big for me :( "
love it! size just right
Have yet to try but so far quality is good. Comes with a push up cups.
Usually an S for sports bras. Not very tight. Makes a better layering top. 
"Fast delivery within 1.5 weeks! Quality is really good too, can double up as a camisole and work out top:) For reference, am 48kg, 24” waist and usually an XS/S and S fits perfectly. M would’ve been too loose — like another that I’ve bought. Will recommend!"
Soft quality and really nice product overall. Shipping is fast too.
Size too small and not expandable 
Bought it during flash sale and got 2 diff colours and sizes. I’m usually a uk6/8 . Size M fits me better and size S is more body hugging which I prefer it to be looser. It’s comfy to wear it as a lounge wear at home !
Initially thought material would be a little thin and not very good but it's actually nice and sturdy and hugs the body just right! 
Sizing fits well and material is decent (not translucent at all). Will definitely order again. 
Quality is good. Suitable for Low impact exercises. Could be worn as casual wear too!
"Bought this pair of tights for a friend who is UK8, fits perfectly."
"Great tops! Can be worn outside as well. Note that the material is stiffer and thicker than usual, so don’t expect it to be as stretchable. But good quality for sure :)"
Comfortable 
nice! the padding was little too thick for my liking but it is removable. so no issues there. I wear UK6/8- I got a M size - it was just right...maybe a little snug - but still ok. 
Not a fan of the inner rubber band but the cut looks pretty 
Nice. love the colour n good quality. Wil buy again 
Fits well and doesn’t shift while working out! Very comfortable. Highly recommend!
"Fits UK6-8, C70-C75. "
"LOVE! Honestly was afraid the purple wld be too dull but it complements my skin tone really well ended up the most in love with the purple out of all the tops (they were all great, good cutting, quality material!) (168cm, 59kg, UK6-8, bought M)"
Item received well packaged. Normally wear a size S for tops. M for this fits well. 
This tank too is very nice. Good padding. Can wear it for workout or just going out. Love it!
"sized up cause of bust size, ordered M before but it doesn’t provide good support for bigger bust size. this one fits okay and quite good support, would be great if the strap is adjustable so we can adjust for body length"
love the quality! am very happy with it. am probably gonna use my own padding... unsure if i bought one size too small?? but still love it
I’m uk 6(?) for TOP and this is slightly big for me but comfortable! Thanks seller :)
"Item took a while to arrive, but quality is good and flattery cut. Comfortable to exercise in."
Material is comfortable. True to size. Will repurchase when there’s a sale again.
"Usually a UK6-8 on top, but even then the top can be a little tight to put on and take off, though the fit is ok once it’s on. Might try to size up next time.k Mok"
The size S appears to be very tight even though usually I wear size S for tops. Hopefully it will get looser as I stretch it
"fits perfectly! decent price for good quality, very fast delivery. will definitely purchase again!"
"Picked size S, equivalent to adidas XS. "
Looks nice but straps were a bit too short. Not very comfortable 
"Love this, well padded and fits well (usual S, sized up)"
Good quality. Happy to receive. Fast delivery also. Thank you seller.
Love this - could also use as a top on its own (super comfy and looks good). Removable paddings. Will be buying again in other colours!
"straps are a little loose,  nonetheless a good product overall considering the price paid. "
Packed individually- as described. Feel the quality is adequate to pricing. Hope it’ll last..
So pleased with my purchase. It works as a top for barre or yoga lessons if you prefer. Or even as a top over high-waisted bottoms. 
A bit shorter than expected
good quality and highly recommended!
"Nicely packed, great material but doesn’t fit that well on me though"
"relatively quick delivery with correct item in good condition, no dents or damage i could see and was packaged in a few layers of plastic protection! satisfied with product :-) "
Fast delivery and well packed. Normal to have sore pain after rolling?

Received in 3 days.
Item well received. Its bigger than expected. There was some prob initially with the delivery but it was promptly action on by the seller. 
"Very sturdy and no faults! A lil heavy but that's good to hold my body weight when I roll! I think the length is just nice for me too, used a nalgene bottle for comparison "
"Quality seems not too bad, price is not expensive and delivery was fast. "
looks good and i’ll be using this for my aching shoulder :(  very fast delivery
Seller reply my enquiries promptly. Delivered within a few days. There is a small dent on blue one. 
Packaging was a bit torn off when I opened the package. Overall good quality and fast delivery. Ordered on Sunday and arrived today.
This is life changing! Product is really good and I feel so good after using it. My body aches are better managed. Highly recommended.
Delivery speed was really fast. Good product and will be back for more. 
Fast delivery within 3 days from date. Product is good value for money.
Good quality. Good price. Good delivery. Feels very good to roll upper back and thighs
Nice colour and good for back though on the heavy side compared to my previous one. 
oh was expecting it to be slightly smaller in circumference but it's sturdy and of quality!
"Time is of good quality, it is hard enough to serve it's purpose. "
Good quality!! Will order again 
"Its sturdy and does the job well, "
Received item in good condition. First time using this so got my son to teach me how to use it to benefit me. 
Ordered on thursday and delivered on saturday. Feels quite sturdy for $11.99. There are some creases/wrinkles on the foam. Hopefully they dont affect the usage and product’s longevity.
"NOTE: DOESN'T INCLUDE THE BLUE SMALL ONE. The delivery was fast, and the quality is real good. Recommended! "
"Happy with the delivery time and product. Received 2 days after placing order and both are sturdy.. think I need to study a bit more on how to properly use the rollers, maybe on YouTube or something"
"Good quality, firm and sturdy roller, cheap price, speedy delivery. Useful for my back, Thank you!"
"Still prefers the normal grid one, this feels too pokey for me. But the qualify is decent"
Received really soon (within a few days)!! Bigger than expected but thats great.  Came with photos of suggested massage techniques. Cant wait to use it! Shoes size 37 for reference

"FAST DELIVERY! Ordered on 3rd Jun, received on the 6th. Can't wait to try it. :)  Seller was really helpful and patient when I met with an issue with the courier service. "
Received within a week. The spikes are firm and it feels good when used. Really presses into you acupoints when you lie on it
"product came within a week, good quality and nice colour as well :) worth the buy "
Tested good so far. This bigger 14cm  diameter Yoga roller work better than those which is smaller at 8cm diameter which cost less than 50% of this item.
Feels really sturdy. And material feels very good as welll. Hope it will last for a while.
Product seems rather sturdy. Fast delivery.

My second purchased. Comfortable .good for long ride
Recieved in good packaging and item quality is good by visual judgement.  The seller picture of this item is exactly alike to what i recieved.  Not bad to recommend to MTB bikers ethusiast...
very gd
Ordered according to size guide and it fits exactly. Quality is good. Delivered ahead of schedule. 
Take quite a while to deliver. Product not too bad.
Slightly loose. Follow according to the chart. Suggest 1 size smaller because it is expandable. Happy riding. 
Comfortable cycling shorts. This is a repeat purchase. 
Size is what i expected. The padding is more like thick foam than gel. But it is proper. Tried it on the bike and it provides the required bumper between your sitting bone and the saddle. Delivery is quite fast. Happy with the purchase! 
Item as described.
thank you for the deal. item is good product. fast delivery. 
Received item in order. Item is as mentioned and will recommend others to buy as it is value for money.

"comfy material, stretchable, but padding abit dented :( "
Good paddings but only can use for light yoga classes. Not sure if can use for hiit classes though. Fast delivery at mail box
Delivery is fast. Material is good. Stripe is adjustable but cannot be remove. 
REALLY REALLY love this bra. The fitting is so good and it gives the body a nice shape
Fabric is smooth but the colour is very dull. The bra pads were also folded and there were dents. Not aesthetically pretty too. Does not look like photo in store.
Friends love it and fast delivery too! Quality good
Fix well. Good quality for the price 
Very nice. 
"The top fits well, but is probably more suitable for light workouts at home cos the paddings don't really fit as well. but its very comfy. it really gives the pushup effect. "
"The bra padding is all bumpy, very obvious. Doesn't create push up bra effect either. "
Well received.  Good material.  Slightly bigger than expected. 
No pain while riding. Just abit tight in the groin 
Size abit small so must upsize
Efficient and fast delivery. 
Item received thanks

"Crushed box but Super happy with the product. Can’t wait to use this and even had a card to recco excercises so I don’t even have to search it up  however, the bands does leave a rubber smell on your hands that only come off when you bathe. Still happy though "
fast delivery & very pretty colours! doesn’t rlly have a strong smell & quality is great for price paid! :)
"Item took quite some time to arrive. I ordered 2, and 1 arrived in a worn out packaging, as if squashed/opened. After trying the bands, I don’t think the material is very good as it scrunches up your leg when it’s stretched."

"Received well, it's well made and the padding looks like it will last but....Tried it once and it doesn't stay firm on the thighs, keeps rolling up and you have to fix it every little bit which is annoying and not looking good in public! Two stars because of the padding only"

"Pruchased on 30 May. Delivered on 05 Jun. Tested it. Comfortable and spongy! Good for those who don't want to expose the thights while wearing sport shorts. But not too sure should wear with label facing inwards or outwards. It gets a bit warm for longer distance. Overall, satisfied!"
Very comfortable. 
Good quality.
Not bad with price paid
Received in good condition. Item as indicated in pic. Yet to try.  
Received the plastic was opened and looked like someone opened it before it was delivered. All squeeze inside small black plastic and made a hole on it to make it like a plastic bag. Refer to photo as I received like that. Anyways all ordered was complete. Only disappointed with how it was delivered
really cute and the quality is great!! super worth it for the price!!
"Ordered on 7/7 and arrived on 15/7, rather fast delivery, really confortable material soft and stretchable however the cup feel and look a bit weird. Not so flattering to wear on its own, cup is too obvious. And not really push up, But good for the price. Longer too than normal sports bra."
Received in good condition. Thank you seller for the fast delivery.
Just received n materials is soft n comfy...I like it...

Fast delivery and pretty satisfied with the quality of the product. 
Very prompt delivery. Received in Good condition 
"ITEM RECIEVED WITHIN 2 DAYS! Chose Ninja van to deliver and it was really gr8. The foam roller is really good in quality, robust and intact. If i went to a retail store this would cost twice the price at least. Really gr8 purchase 10/10 recommend"
Item delivered as described.  Fast delivery too.  Recommended 
"I like that the product came with a plastic wrap. However, I find the product not effective enough in massaging my back, in my opinion, like it massages a bit but not ""deep"" enough in my muscles. "
Came nicely packed and quality looks good. Yet to try. 
thanks
Fitted nicely
Nice item  
Took 14 days to reach my letterbox.  Quality looks good but should have got one size larger.  Looks like sports pants inner lining 
"The short was delivered faster then expected. Is as shown in the ad posting. The size is slightly on the small side, but overall is ok. Will have to see how long the material last."
Bought 2 diff sizes because i fall in between. Wore the L/XL. Fits ok but the bottom part keeps rolling up. So might be a little loose for my sizing. Thing S\M will be a good fit. Went for a run with this and it stays put well! Recommended!
good materials and soft. buying some for my friends.... thank you 
Not bad. For the price its not too thin or loose with adjustable straps 
bought this many many times but it’s like it got a bit shorter than when i bought it last time 
Received in good condition 
Very comfortable. The quality of the material is really good. I will definitely purchase more of this!
"came as shown, pushup doesnt really do much ngl but overall satisfied,, didnt expect the material to not feel cheap :D"
Very good material!! Fit me well! Definitely will come back! 
Really like the product. The strap is adjustable and product design is really nice.
Delivery took awhile due to Circuit Breaker but overall very satisfied with my purchase.  The bands seem sturdy and even came with some exercise instructions
bands have a weird rubbery smell to it. material feels very thin and the heaviest band doesn’t feel very impactful.  but overall not bad for the price
"Delivery takes super long, but the quantity looks good and the color is nice! "
Delivery was slow but items are well received 
Product is true to what was described! Can’t wait to use it. 
Took 3 weeks to arrive (prob due to circuit breaker period) but quality is not bad. Comes with a small bag to store the bands.
Material good bought 2 sizing Will reorder
The product is Good quality as per picture. delivery is on time as well
"XL suits me, 180cm, W 33. Comfortable. "
"Order well received but kind of long. Nevertheless, it quite comfortable to wear for cycling "
Not exactly that comfortable for female. Didn’t know it is meant for man as it was not stated in Seller’s description here. Saw some female buyers review thats why I decided to take it in good faith. For normal riding female should not order this model. It feels weird. 
Ordered on 17 May and received on 29 May. Item is the same as in picture. Working as advertised. Mesh cloth and comfy to use. Highly recommended! 
Items well packed and arrived quite on time about 5 days.very satisfied with the material . Very comfortable to wear and I recommend hand wash so you won’t overstretch and cause looseness of the whole support. Very matching with yoga sports pants. Or you can even match with jacket and jeans or pan
Items is very nice satisfied .  But I'm a quite disappointed with wrong sizes that the seller send.  It's my 3rd time purchased 
Wow this items I order last week and the shoppe said will deliver about 2 weeks but come early and I'm happy I can wear already. 
"Ordered on 28/6, received on 7/7. Bra padding is very weird when worn. Material quality is OK but a little disappointed with the bra padding. "
Material is soft. 
Super comfy! Very affordable. Will buy other colors. Only bought 3 colors. Size is just nice for a l size wearer. 
Item is good Took 2 weeks only to reach me thank you 
Order received much early as the promise date. 
material difficult to dry. hope theres bigger size anyways. thank you.
"Received items as ordered.  This order is for the 2 higher grade, feel is much better than the lower grade/price.  Like it, and will recommend to my friends. Thanks."
Awesome product and fast shipping

Grid Foam Rollers  are the lightest among the foam rollers listed here. Personally i use it for recovery of Sore Muscles such as after a Ultra Marathon Run. The flat surface maintains a larger surface contact and promotes blood flow by a To and Fro rolling Action

Delivery was quick and the quality is good considering the price.
Item recieved as stated! Really love it! Thank you v much!! (:

"recieved yesterday, and it fits me"
Received the Items today ! the quality is good and it has nice fitting 
"Bought three, the colours all correspond to the web images. It's a good stretchy material that is not too thick so it feels very nice when you wear it to work out. The only downside is that the removable cups have a weird shape."
Received them within a week and the material is really good. It was well made and had really good padding. Highly recommended. Was a bit small for large chested though.
"Good quality & so comfortable to wear , I’m 160cm & 50kg fit very well for me "

My second time purchasing it. It is so comfy
Nice 
received it! am wearing it now it’s quite comfortable. but not recommended support as a sports bra for vigorous exercise. if you’re just doing strength/resistance exercise it’s fine :) oh ya but if u have ‘love handles’ the rubber below may roll up haha. but it’s really very cheap no complaints!  
"I really like this product, super nice and comfortable. Very fast deliveries. "
"Item says size L/XL but looks like XS. No size indication on the clothing, but able to fit because material is soft and stretchable and looks like a free size yoga bra. Bra sponge will move around"
"I’m a 32C and got size S/M and it’s a bit loose at the back. The material is soft but quite thin. Not suitable for high impact sports or running, more suitable for walking or casual wear. The colour is also a bit odd irl. "
"Material rides up once in awhile, other than that it’s fairly ok"
"fast delivery, item as picture "
Repeated purchase. I like the material and fit

"Good quality,  fast delivery "
Great item visually. Haven't try. 
Slow delivery and shopee sucks as a platform

Good quality and value for money 
"Great product fits really well, affordable price and item came as how it was in picture. "
Received in good order. Feels good but too small for me.
"Good quality and packaging. Accidentally bought the wrong size. Usually these products are 1 size smaller than normal, didnt expect XXL to be huge. "
See picture. Disparity in sizes. Beware when purchase white Color bra. Rest of Color is ok. Seller said size info upload is mistake. Only apologise. Smaller chest will find it loose.

Very gd value for the price. Delivery was so fast. Am very satisfied with foam roller
Purple rumble roller received in good condition. Great for rolling the glutes and calves.
"Very fast delivery, and well packed. "
Colour of foam roller is pretty! Arrived in good condition. The round rumble really hurts and can get into deep pressure points. Will take awhile to get used to it! 
Came in good condition. Really good to use as it helped stretched my right muscles. 
"Gotta admit the padding is weird but u can take it out n cut it whatsoever. Other than that, altho support is not that good (cos the straps are thin), it still can hold and do what a bras shld do! "
Thin material . Not much elasticity. Lose but comfortable. Inner foam is bummpy looks and feel. 
Fast delivery n received item in good condition n quite good for the price

Came exactly as photo. Worth the money!
Received item within a week of ordering. Wasn’t expecting much but was pretty surprised at the quality and comfort of this bra. It’s really comfortable. The padding is uniquely shaped and may not be to everybody’s liking. There is very little support but can still be used for yoga/home wear

Ur call is not bad bro but you can come over here for a little bit I will

I had order many time from this shop. There is always wrong delivery in size. As in the photo you can see there is a different in size which I had order 2pic XL but why there is different in size. Seller is very irresponsible font recommend. 
Good condition and fast delivery. Thank you.............
"Very soft and comfy, I love it! The straps are adjustable. Thank you seller."
"Well considering it’s only $3, it actually exceeded my expectation but do be mindful that it’s not sport bra materials and shouldn’t be used for high intensity workout. It’s still a pleasant top though. "

good quality very soft and nice !!!!
It's really nice but super sheer. The material is comfy though. 
 
The padding is thick. Delivery was quite fast. Have yet to try Cycling with it but so far it looks promising. 
This gel padding is more comfortable for longer distance ride compared to the cheap sponge padding.
Item received as promised. no defect and its comfortable
Fast and efficient delivery. Item looks good. Hopefully it lasts 
Item well packed in nice ziplock bag. Item well receive. Nice breathable material. Sure comfort by the material.

 I’m in love with the bra! I bought brown and black L/XL and it fits me nicely. Really like it and love it !! 
Yes Very Good And Comfortable Tks Delivery service 
Good!! Love the stretchy quality. Not good for vigorous exercise but yoga is ok. Will definitely repurchase!!
The material is not bad but size a bit small for me.
Tq recieved  
"I do not think the push up is really working, but still ok, maybe the size too small for me (60kg, B cup)"
Fast delivery with good quality product. It’s firm and really helps my tight muscles to loosen up. Will take a while to get used to it. Overall satisfied. 
fast delivery! seller was nice to change a foam roller for me because one item sent wrongly. will definitely buy again 
The edge looks abit dirty but acceptable. Speedy delivery! 
Very firm - does its job! Abit painful if you roll on the middle of your back as the one I got has the “bumps” all around and will “poke” your spine. Overall a good buy! Helps provide a quick relief of very tight upper and lower back from desk bound work. 
This is real fast delivery!!! Purchase yesterday and received at 10am next day! 
More of a teal colour than green. Nevertheless it works good.
Arrived a bit dirty but in good condition
Wow super fast!! Same day delivery!! Great quality of product too 
Item received really fast due to ninjavan. Item is slightly shorter than photo but it’s fine! Feels really good to use
Fast delivery and sturdy. Good buy. Will recommend to friends.
Product looks dirty and used. 
quick delivery by ninjavan to selected ninjaspot. product works fine as per photo
Super comfy and good! I’m going to get more! 
Super great & comfortable! I just ordered again Thanks seller!
Well pack and fast delivery. Colors nice and quite comfortable to wear however the inside padding a bit weird look awkward can’t expect more 
Received in good order.its soft
Not bad. Cheap and good. 
"Ordered twice, and the quality is reasonable for the price paid. It is worth it! Thank you"
"Really soft and comfortable. Padding doesn't feel too thin, so should suffice for moderate activity levels. S/M size is just nice for a UK 8/10, and it's good that the shoulder straps are adjustable. For the price, very good value and will buy again. "
"Very comfortable, but no support and the inserts do not wrap around so it gives a ""lumpy"" appearance. Good to wear at home"
Colour true to seller image. Material is quite soft and smooth 
product received. just to feedback about the padding a bit wrinkled. maybe put on the box instead of plastic bag. So it won't be crumpled. Other than that the quality is okay. Thank you 
Good~Will purchase again.
It’s fitting is comfortable and the size is just nice. Satisfied.
Reliefs tense muscles well. Can be wuite painful to use for some but if you can tolerate the pain then it is quite shiok. Item seems pretty durable too. 
"Receive in a few days, seems pretty solid. Hopefully will work."
Ordered on Saturday and it arrived on Monday night! Super smooth delivery and I can’t wait to use it! 
Received the items quite fast. Quality seems good after 2 days of usage
"If you're new to foam roller, it's advisable to get e grid foam roller as it's more gentle.  Rounded rumble is good for deeper massage but can be painful at sore area. But it's good if you really want deep massages, just bear the pain. "
Nice colour....my son love it.. Thank you seller and Shopee
"Fast delivery, and it feels really solid. Can’t wait to start using it. "
"Love the colour, quality is good and less than half the price of decathalon! "
"Fast processing fast delivery! Product as expected, great for hard to reach back massage"
"Good quality, super fast delivery:)"
Quality is good has a weight to it!
"Hi, placed ordered on 23 Oct 2019 and received it on 25 Oct 2019. 2 days delivered from SG. Bought 2 types of rollers, these rollers looks and felt sturdy and strong. Quite good and comfortable when rolled onto. Material is smooth, really nice. Hopefully can get rid of my fatigue after my running.  "
good quality and received very quickly!
"Item received quickly, though navy blue was just blue."

Super fast delivery items received well and as described!!

Comfy shorts 
Item received well. Quality as per picture. Cushion quite thick. 
Order received in good condition. Padding is good. Will buy again
 my son love it. 
"Had to wear more than once to adapt to it and feel comfortable with it. Other than that, it does provide the cushion for long-hours cycling. It definitely helped to relieve the pain/uncomfortableness i used to feel when cycling long hours. "
Tried riding bike with it. Seemed a little bit hard. Took 11 days to reach me after order date
Quality is better than expected 
Nice sport bra..good quality 
"Ordered 2 tops but received only one. Made a request for refund and was immediately approved/refunded. Item is comfortable, plan to wear it as sleeping attire. "
"Bought brown and black, the brown looks more like a nude. But its okay. But the cutting of the two bra is different. But both in the same size. The black cutting is smaller "
"Fast delivery, received in good condition but yet to try."
"Just received them a few minutes ago!  Indeed, the quality of these bralettes are super good despite its cheap price.  Very happy with my first order from this seller, and will definitely buy from them in future. Thanks, seller!  "

Nice mat.. very good quality for beginner like myself... worth buy... 
Delivery took a while but understandable due to Covid19. Love the thickness of the mat when kneeling. Thankful for the bag and strap. Slight rubber smell when opening but all is good. Might buy again.
Items received in good condition. Worth the money. Thank you very much seller.
"really good quality! the colour of the mat is as shown in picture too :) however, do note that the mat isn’t really anti-slip so it’s more suitable for low impact workout. but overall, I’m very happy with this purchase! "
"Item came quick and well packaged. I didnt know that when you just order the mat, it comes with a bag and strap so now i have 2 bags and 2 straps. When i first opened the mat up, it had a fishy smell to it but after airing it out, the smell is gone. Overall a good product."
Soft and thick yoga mat. Yet to use. 
Product came well wrapped and is light. Slight smell but should be fine after airing. 
"Packaging of mat was torn when it arrived :( Mat was also torn where packaging was torn. While everything else was fine, the mat was only 8mm thick as shown in the picture. "
"okay for the price, material isn’t fantastic as it feels like foam more than a yoga mat. but overall it comes with a nice bag and pouch. "
"Fast n efficient delivery during CB day , great product "
"Received in good condition! Mat is thick and good for workouts, good purchase!"
Received mat in good condition. However the bottom of the mat cover was slightly worned out. Ok for light use.
Happy with the purchase! Not really anti slip but can work.Good for yoga
"Delivery time is fast, received in a week. Bought 2 mats and it came rolled together, as a result the external layer suffered some dents and scratches but inner layer is good. Other than that the quality looks okay, thick and not too slippery for me."
Well packed condition and promptly delivered. Mat is 10mm thick but feel light weight compared to those bought in guardian or watson. Good for statics exercise like planks or push ups. Not recommended for burpee or climbers. Tks seller. 
Fast delivery. Ordered on 6/6 and arrived on 13/6. Came well packed. Good quality and no chemical smell. Free carrier bag and a sling for easy keep. Thank you. 
"The quality of the yoga mat is great, feels comfortable with exercises required kneeling  "
Yoga map is not anti slip as advertise and not recommended for jumping or hopping exercise as mat is not firm on ground.  Basic yoga and stretching is still okay. Not recommended. 
"Thick and good quality. Non-skid, but if you sweat profusely, it will skid. Worth it"
Looks good can’t wait to try it out 
Thick material. Good. 
Fast delivery. Product as per described with bag and strap. Good mat at its price point.
Good quality! Comes with a carrier bag and also a strap to secure the yoga mat
Hi awesome delivery.. With good products. Will order again
A very nice mat.My first time purchase n very satisfy with ths product.
Look like a foam than a mat . A bit disappointed 
Item received in gd condition. Reliable. Thank you seller.
Nice.
The mat size is slightly wider than the one I bought from Guardian (blue). Length is about the same and much thicker though. Has more cushion when kneeling down. One side is smooth surface and the other side has broad stripes. 
"It is soft and of good length, came with elastic strap and casing for easy storage / bringing it out "
"Product was delivered within 2 weeks, material is good. There’s a weird smell when just open but after a while no more already. "
Thick and well package came with bag thumbs up 
I love how thick and soft the mat is and that it came with it's own casing. The surface material feels abit cheap though. I can tell it will tear/shred easily after a few uses. 
"Fast 3 days delivery!! Nicely packaged, and there are no creases at all!! Will get a second one for my sis"
Strong rubber (?) smell which needs to be aired out. Thick and seems of good quality
"Received in good condition.Like the quality,cannot wait to try it "
Still okay. Material is still acceptable for the price but is not that durable. Have torn a small area when exercise.   Can consider if u need to carry your yoga mat around as it is very light. But would prefer a heavier mat though for exercise 
Not bad quality apart from some scar on it. Really antislip.
Received in one week+ and in good condition :) Comes with strap and bag as mentioned. Nice and thick which is good for knees support. 
Got a bit of scratches but quality not bad. 
Not bad.. I thought will be thicker and more sturdier.. looks good.. not sure if it can last long
Great product although still a little slippery when you sweat 
Mat is comfortable and thickness is as described but it is the “non-slip” is non-existent
"Fast delivery, thick, Come with transparent protective sheet. Picture is after I open up the sheet and put it back to take photo. My wifey is happy with my purchase."
Gd Quality ! 
The quality is extremely poor. I try to do split and foam surface cracked.
Items are packed nicely and the mat is thick and comes with its own bag  
"Very soft and thick a little slippery but no issue for me since i do mostly static exercises. There is some slight odor, hooe it will go away after a while"
Nice! My daughter loves it
Good good good good good good
Took about 2 weeks to received the item during CB. I’m satisfied with the delivery time as the item was shipped from China 
Nice to use..Thick but antislip is not really good..Delivery is a bit slow..
"The mat is thicker than normal in the market. The material is quite firm. Not too hard or too soft. Thanks seller for being considerate giving the bag, very convenient easy to keep"
Low quality
The quality is ok ok ... got squeaky sounds... but overall fairly good
Too slippery 
 Good
Good quality and arrived very quickly 
So far so good. It’s really thick and come with a bag to contain. Satisfied
The thickness is already a winner. It's rather comfortable. The grip against the floor can be an area of improvement. 
Good package and nice product. Need to air it though cos there is a smell.  No regret buying. 
Awesome item..my wife loves it
Quality exceeded my expectations with the price. 
comfortable because its thicker
"Light, big, got about smell"
If was packed nicely. It is quite a good material and also quite thick. The delivery was quite fast. Would buy it again next time I guess . 
"Rubber material, thick enough to do exercises but there were some defects upon receiving it"
Nicely pack and good quality mat.
"Not grid at all, nearly slip & fall while doing exercise on it "
item yake sometime to reached. 
Good quality. Fast delivery
Received it in just over a week. The quality of the product is quite good. 
Mat is no slip without footwear. Delivery took a while though
"Ordered on 8th may, delivered on 20th may   Thick cushion and feels soft. Comes with free carry bag and strap. Doesnt slip but makes a sound when moving on it (e.g. doing mountain climbers) "
Not a bad yoga mat but came with a few folds here and there but it’s fine 
Fast and delivery 
"Delivery was faster than expected, considering the CB. Mat seems good too"
The mat is thick enough to protect my knees. Has very strong smell. Maybe after a while it will be gone. 
"Delivery was super fast Quality not bad, pretty thick, comes with bag and band to roll the mat up"
Product came way earlier than expected! Bravo! 
Quality mat. Super satisfied with the quality! 
Great quality! 
"Nice and comfortable, non slip surface. Colour is nice and it seems to roll up easily. Came relatively quickly and delivery man was polite, however best not to ask customer to sign off during this covid 19 period.  Overall 4.5/5, this is the cheapest I can find on both Shopee and Lazada for the qu"
Item as described 
Good quality and thickness even tho delivery was quite long 
mats came in good condition with straps and bag!! Satisfied with the products:)
Fast delivery.
Fast delivery and quality looks great. Worth buying. Thanks seller!
Not anti slip at all.  Quite disappointed. 
This yoga mat is not working for me. It’s very slippery and keep moving during my cardio workout. Regret for bought this and it wasted my money. 
Product is as advertised. Good!
Stock arrive quite fast. Very comfortable. Material is thick
"Material is soft and thick, dont know how long it will last before the surface gets torn though. "
"I thot it doesnt come with a bag hence I ordered & paid for the bag. Now, I end up with 2 bags for 1 mat."
Great nice product! Well worth. 
Item well received and good customer’s service!
"Bought for my daughter, she like it so much "
"anti slip, quite thick but the smell is quite strong"
"Item came in 10 days. Came with the strap and bag as pictured and assured by customer service. Just did light yoga on it, it’s thick enough. Just not sure if it’s able to last, since material is quite soft. But good for it’s price! "
Delivery was a bit delayed due to CB but item was well received. Thick and good support!
Received it within a week! It is 10mm thickness as specified!
Awesome thick and nice parcel was delivered pretty quickly
"Satisfied with the purchase. Material is relatively thick but not heavy. Comes with two additional items: a strap and a holder. Due to the material, creases and some scratches but had expected them. It would be the same even if purchased from retail shops."
Item received In good condition. No scratches or defect. Just very strong smell which can get rid off by airing. Mat is also thick enough to protect tailbone when doing situp. 
received in good condition !! seems quite comfortable to workout in :D happy with the purchase thank you! 
Item as described... Thick and not too hard. ..reasonable delivery time... Comes with sling and bag.
came with a bad and straps! no weird smell and feels pretty soft 
Soft and thick. Will try it soon but im happy with this purchase at a reasonable cost. The blue which i recieved is quite different from the blue in the image. But thats not any big issue.
Fast delivery. Thick material. It’s soft too. Good for yoga and exercise 
Item came in good condition and was quickly delivered. Came with the straps and the bag!
happy w purchase thanks seller :)
Thickness and non slip is as advertised and really comfortable. 
Fast delivery and I received it in good condition. The quality is good and no rubber smell. Would buy again. 
Received with thanks 
Fast shipments and the mat is really thick. Quality looks good. The strap is a little short given how thick the mat is.
Yoga mat has some plastic smell. But still tolerable. Is long enuf and comes with a bag and band.
Well received. Need to leave it out to air away the plasticky smell.
"Received, well packed and good quality with the price paid. Satisfy purchase. "
Swift delivery. 5 days to receive it. Fit nicely. But material very thin. 
"Great for static exercises like yoga, push ups, planks. However, not suitable for strenuous exercise like mountain climbers etc. The mat will make squeaky noises and slip off. Update, the foam has started to rub off"
Received in good condition! The mat is pretty thick and it comes with a bag and strap for storage or if you wanna bring out!! Really good!
item arrived earlier than i expected. both sides of the mat are the same material. and it comes with the bag too 
Thick mat. Love it 
well packaged and yoga mat bag comes together with it. highly recommended !
Received in good condition! And i love the colour! Thank you so much! Will definitely refer to friends! 
Received with satisfied condition
"Highly recommended and worth buying. The thickness is just right, not too thin."
Item received. Have some defect at the purple mat.
Good thickness and supports well. The material on close up seems easy to spoil. Hope it lasts! So far so good! Good buy. 
"Nice product and nice seller, recommended shop. Thanks!"
Product is perfect. Just as advertised. Nat is thick and looks very durable.
Received in good conditions and items as described. Good quality 
Received in fairly good speed. Thank you for the delivery. Product is very light and the parcel almost rolled away when left at the doorstep. The mat bag and strap are all included. The mat surface dries fairly quickly. Happy with the purchase. Thank you. 
Received in one week. Happy with the product. Thank you so much.
Received in good conditions ;) but it does not absorb the sweet from my body... the foam gets wet & slippy...
"came with a carrying case/strap which is very useful. can be a bit slippery on the base but that might reduce with more use, but the thickness is very comfortable for knees and back when using it. overall good value for money and delivery was quite fast too during CB, thanks!"
Described as the title. Love it! Delivery is fast and I’m impressed 
"Item is well received, no defects on mat. Delivery is fast despite the circuit breaker period. Noted that the mat gets kinda slippery when it comes in contact with sweat. Nevertheless, worth for value"
"Ordered this on 12th May 2020, received the 2 mats on 20th May.   Yoga mats do have a new smell, but not too bothered by it and just a quite wipe down works. Compared to an old yoga mat at home, quite impressed with this mat’s thickness, it indeed is 1cm thick. Provides good support on knees&Back!"
Very thick and soft. quite nice to use for yoga and stretching but it’s quite squeaky when doing jumping exercises like mountain climbers or jumping jacks.
"Fast delivery. The product came in about a week after order. It came with a strap and a carry bag, which makes it easy and convenient for keeping and carrying around."
Delivery took just 4 days! Came as advertised. Thanks seller!
Fast delivery! Got bit of smell but air it out and it will be fine 
It’s not exactly what it described. It’s a soft form board and I don’t think it will stay 10mm over time. It arrived before ETA but I’ll not buy again that’s for sure. Suitable for children to do their tumbling but not good for adults above 50kg.
"mat is thick, seems to be good quality, came faster than expected. also came with free bag to carry it around "
The e exercise yoga mat is surprisingly thick. My kiddos love it. The bag is very useful. It also comes with a strap if you dont want to use bag to contain it.
Not yet tried but looks good. Fast delivery.
"Just received,,tq"
Its ok but abit flimsy when used. Maybe due to the rubber part at the end. Otherwise its ok
"Received in good condition, thanks for the small gift I like it very much."
"Nice, perfect for workout on free time... No damage good packing..."
Good quality! 
Received with good condition
Came with elastic band and mesh bag. Mat is very light. 
Its thick but quite slippery. Hopefully it is non slip when working out. 
Ordered on 25-Apr-20 received on 4-May-20. Have not try but rubber smell is strong.
Prompt delivery! :)
There’s scratches 
Very good quality
"Overall ok quality, very soft..little damaged at the corner.. may be during shipping.  Comes with carrier and strap.. no need to order separately which I did and paid extra 3$."
The mat is thick and dense. But it's more slippery than watson/guardian yoga mat. maybe will become more sticky over time. Delivery is faster than expected. 
Product is well received!
Received in good condition. Well wrapped! Seller gave me a small key chain as a gift . I'm very happy with their hospitality. Thank you!! 
Very easy and convenient to use. 
"Item received in good condition, colour as described. thanks"

Very good quality! The mat is thick & comfy to lay on! Just the bag doesn’t look very durable but the mat definitely durable! No smell anything 
"Good delivery, product works, but a bit slippery"
material is something like styrofoam kinda? the thickness is not too bad and comes with a free bag (:
Item recieved fast and in good condition 
"Fast delivery and really thick and good. Only flaws is that it has creases at 1 end as shown in the 3rd pic. It is anti slip on my homogeneous tiles but quality is so so. But for the price paid, I think it is ok. I did my low impact cardio workout and already I can see some markings. "
it's really good and the quality is nice ...thank you to the seller and the man who delivered for me...

"Quality so-so, entire item is made of foam. Doesnt seems to last. Will try out and see how. "
Looks good hope that it wouldnt break so easily. Delivery was bad it was dumped at the walkway. 
"Functional,  product received in good condition.  Correct colour received. Thank you.... "
Faster delivery then expected Thanks seller this is my second purchase for my friend This is good for exercise highly recommended 
 Items received promptly. Quality of the items are very good! Thanks!
Item is true to the seller picture. Very lightweight good material and definitely veey affordable. 
"Delivery took slightly over a week. Item was nicely packaged and arrived in good condition. Mat is sufficiently thick for daily exercise and material is good, just a little rubber smell that goes away after airing for a while."
Prompt delivery. Excellent 
"The mat is thick and non-slippery. Much more comfortable than my previous mat bought from drugstore. Though pricier, it’s worth it.  "
Took slightly 2 weeks to arrive. The mat is thicker than usual yoga mat. The bottom layer had some scratches or prints because it was wrapped with the mat netting cover. Overall satisfied with this buy. 
"Pad material is thick, but looks very easily torn.  Have strong smell.  Probably need to air it for few days."
its kinda slippery ..
Mat came super fast. Item as per described. Fantastic . Will purchase other items.
Not bad the yoga mat except it is a little longer. Material a bit foamy. Hope it can last long. Color chosen is very appealing. Consider fast shipmemt
Thick mat! Good quality. Delivery was ok. Comes w a bag. Thanks 
"Seller shipped out the item quickly as I needed it. But the quality is not very good, it’s very soft and it has the smell even though I aired it for a few days. So everytime I work out I will have to smell it. Its only ok for yoga.  Update : its SUPER SLIPPERY, slip so many times while doing HIIT. "
Good Quality
came well wrapped and delivered at a decent time :) item came with a bag and mat itself is actually quite light which may not be heavy to stay on the ground... prob will not purchase again for the price. it’s decent tho
Receive in a good condition shipping is just what stated in the post.delivery service ..can try to have a mini gym exercise at home..thanks For the gift

Item delivered as described! I think it is a good product to exercise your body. Especially your stomach. It is too early to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness at this time.
haven't get to it use it yet received in time received in good condition
Item come in good condition also useful.
Thank you
Mat feels thick enough for home workout and did not slip when I did light intensity workout. 
Nicely packed all my 3 items. 
Haven’t try it yet but looks like it’s good quality 
Received it quite quickly. Quality was not bad for this price. 
The mat quality is no good . And is very slippery . I trusted the review but at my disappointment .  Please do not buy this .  Seller : please do not explain and say it is anti non slip . Please try on yourself without shoes on the wave side or both side And video us. Make sure u do not fall . 
"Fast delivery. Packaging was properly done. The mat is alittle slippery on smooth surfaces, thickness not exactly 10mm, was about 8mm but quality still considered okay. "
"not a lot of friction for both sides,  mat cannot be laid out straight, ends are curled up, mat moves when exercising,  thickness good though "
Delivery by speed post.   Value for money.  Material is acceptable.   Comes with casing and strap.  
"Giving it 3 stars for the speedy delivery, however it’s not a mat for high intensity workout. It gives off squeaky sounds when I do workouts like burpees/ mountain climbers. And i slip off pretty easily. So yeah"
Received within a week! In good condition 
"Items as described and quality is good for price, very nice cushioning. Highly recommended. "
"Item received in good condition, exactly as advertised."
"Ordered 2May, received 8May, fast delivery, thickness is good, exactly I wanted, will recommend to buy "

"It look like wouldn,t last long but is cheap so is okay for me. Iterm took 12 days to ship and delivery."
Well received with thanks 
Received the item. Super low quality and fragile. Not recommended. 
"Received in good condition, 10 days delivery is reasonable during this circuit breaker period Thanks for the key chain as free gift"
Took 2 weeks to arrive. Item look ok. Although is upgraded with 4 ropes but still not very strong tension. 
seems soft and thick. can’t wait to try it. have to open up and air out the plastic smell. seems to stay in place n not slide about. comes with the bag as well for storage.

satisfied 
Quality is not bad!! Hopefully it will last for at least a few months :)

"Bought multiple items and it took 3 weeks to arrive, items ordered are correct. Have yet to use the resistence training tension. Still waiting for another package cos at point of order, too many items in cart so had to separate to 2 orders."
Not bad.  Tension is strong.  Good for exercise.  
"Logistics was surprisingly not as slow as expected, product seems decent however i don't think it would last for long as the 4 bands are actually hollow elastic tubes. "
Received the item in good condition and with a cute key chain as a free gift. Thank you so much! Highly recommended with a 5

Tried it and its good. Definitely will recommend my friends to this. Thumbs up!! 
"Fast delivery, worth the price"
Quality seems value for price
Fast delivery! Within 7 days in my letterbox. :). Happy with my purchase. Length of rope easily adjust. Though the handle felt light but I think okay to put in some skipping weights.
Item received in good condition. Properly pack. Delivered was okay. 
Packed nicely and fast delivery. The rope is easy to adjust. 
Delivery super fast. Item in great condition thank you
Nice packaging and good quality service with fast delivery’s.

Comes as per picture. Easy to adjust. 
Excited to use this. Hopefully I can get fitter with the help of the skipping rope. 
bought for my mom since she said she wants to start skipping but until now she also too lazy exercise so idk whether it’s good or not 
Delivery was fast 
"Delivery was fast, came within a week! Quality looks good enough for the price. "
Well received! Item looks good and the skipping rope is tangle-free like what it claims to be! 
Lightweight but too flimsy. It does not give me a good experience skipping with this. Plus side is that it is easy to adjust.
Great and niceeeeeeeeeee delivery is a little slow but item is in good condition 
Surprisingly fast delivery. Adjustable length. Worth the price... 
"Good, thank you for the fast delivery. Item is well received and packaged well. "
Fast delivery. The length of the rope is adjustable and the handles are comfortable to grip. Good buy.
Worth buying it.
Great buy. Worth the price. Super fast delivery. Thank youuuu! 
Good and sturdy material. The adjusting is limited though.
Order received  Product in good condition  Affordable price
Yet to try
So so hurt if hit. Not recommending to buy.  
Came as advertised. The grip is really nice to hold. Satisfied. Hope it last me! ̈ 
Good material Long enough for me to use it can’t wait to use it to exercise 
I love the product! i shall order it again and recommend it to my family

Fast delivery.  Item as described with bearing. Length is adjustable. Like it.
Product as listed
Delivery was quite fast and overall worth the money!
"Received about a week after purchase. Looks good, length is perfect for me don’t even need to adjust. Haven start using but is worth the price and will definitely buy again if need in the future. "
great 
"It is easy to adjust, however, the space in the handle is not enough for the excess rope to fit. Not recommended for petite people trying this. I am 1.66m. Bear in mind after using it for awhile, it will twist itself up. Overall not a bad product, handle is soft."
Good quality. Recommended 
love it very quality skipping rope and adjustable as well! recommended 
Received in 5 days with good condition.  Thank you! 
Order arrived the following week. Item is as described. Thank you seller.
The ropes seems a little too short for me.. haven’t try out w it yet 
"Delivery faster than expected but the item was damaged when I opened it. For such a cheap item, I didn’t opt to ask for return as it’s a total waste of time. Otherwise, the rope functions as intended! Happy with my purchase overall."
good rope! grip is fine too! tho idk how it can be adjusted... 
Good item
Quick delivery and item arrived in good condition. Hopefully durability is long
Good and easy to adjust rope length!

Superrrrrr fast delivery thank you
Looks good 
"Fast and efficient delivery, yet to open and try item but hope its good"
Really happy with the purchase. Weighted and quality. 
item came in as expected!!:)
Nice. Grip is very comfortable and length of rope is just nice for my height. Im 1.65m. Ty!
Well received in good condition! Pretty good quality and lightweight. 
Rope looks sturdy and just like pic
Delivery took about 1 week. Very good quality. Like it. Can adjust length too. 
"Ok rope for this price, adjustment is easy. Excercise works ok with this rope."
"Good item, fast delivery. But item came with slight defect where the foam for the handle is damaged but it’s all right!"
Good value for money...adjustable rope 
Looks not bad for the price paid.  
Item looks good. Length is long too
Long delivery time waited for more than 2 weeks.  Yet to try will further review thanks seller 
"Fast shipment within 2 weeks during CB, rope is adjustable. :)"
Love it!
Good skipping rope. Recommended for adults. Painful if misjump and whip yourself. 
Received through letterbox through SingPost. Product is new.
"Good , Fast delivery "
"Item received in good condition! Used it a few times, it doesn’t get tangled and I like that the handle is really soft! :)"
Item came as described. Delivery too quite a long time to arrive.. hopefully it serves its purpose
Quality is very light compare to crossrope. The reason is there is no wire inside to add weight compare to the ads which indicates embedded wire but really don't have. See 3rd photo. Maybe good for beginners who really never do jump ropes yet.
Delivered in good condition. Product as per description and thumbs up for the delivery speed. Yet to try it out but should be worth the price paid.
Received in good order and condition. Thanks 
Fast delivery and good item..
overall good
Product is not tangle free but delivery came early. Thank you 
Item looks goods. Have not yet try it. Hopefully it won't tangle and last longer. 
Received the item in good condition. cant wait to try it...thank you
"Quick and efficient delivery, took less than 2 weeks. And product seems relatively sturdy "
Good quality ropes!! Thanks!!
Good  . better than my old ropes 
Love this skipping rope. It was easy to adjust to my height and it’s great for beginners like me. Used it around 3 times so far and it’s durable. Would recommend!
"Nice for its price. I was expecting more weight, but still perfect for workouts!"
Goods received as described.. it was delivered by SingPost 
Looks very good. Hope it works and fast delivery too. Thank you
Looks durable and value for it’s quality!
"Okay received the product aft quite a long wait I guess cos of the current situation, package is fine and all. "
"arrived quite fast but the rope is very long, have to adjust before using. other than that good for the price"

bought a black speed rope! good quality and no regrets. fast delivery as well
Bought during flash sale at $0.99. Very worth it. Material is lightweight and looks sturdy.
Ship from SG . Received super fast. Quality looks good. Thanks seller

Good fast delivery.
"Very fast shipping, bought at flash sales. Highly recommended!"
Fast delivery. Items received in good condition 
"fast delivery, thank u so much :) will be using this during this period"
"Ordered on 23 June, received on 26 June. The item was shipped out really fast. While the quality is not the best, it’s decent for the price."
Great buy! Both are adjustable as well which makes it great for me :)
Quality is quite good and really light weight. Will take a while to straighten it out while jumping
Fast delivery. Good quality product. Bought during flash sale. Good deal
Nice. Bubble wrap and plastic wrap also. Double protection. Protection is always good right?????  anyways time to lose some weight. Haah! 
"Fast delivery, good product! Thanks will buy again if needed "
Receive it 4 days later after placed the order. Nice service and will buy again next time if needed  
fast delivery.. however the product quality is very bad. too small. no durable.. and hooks and screws can easily detach. 
Very very fast delivery ! Great product for such low price Thanks!
"Fast delivery, ordered on 7th and received on 9th! Tried and it works well, length easily adjustable too :)"
Works as it should. No flaws 
Fast delivering. works well. thank you
received in good condition! 
Nicely package and fast delivery !
The rope was delivered in good condition. The delivery came within a few days. Have yet to try it. 
Got the speed rope and it’s really worth the price! 
Both speed and training ropes lack weight. Did not enjoy the workout from these. Used to the weight from the decathlon ropes better.   Would not buy again.
"Item well received with thanks. As per described. Have used it today - lightweight, good to use and length is just nice. "
Nice products. Training rope is too short .
Haven't used item. Item looks cheap. Like not worth it.
good quality and material! the delivery was fast despite covid-19.
good quality well received. thank you very much! so far no issues
so far no issues. received it today and am very satisfied :))
"Order received! In a shocked, the status of order didn’t update on the app. Hence this came to my surprise today! "
"bought the orange one, cheap and good! will be working out during this cb"
"Fast delivery, item came as expected "
Item was received inngood condition. Delivery was on time as well. 
Very very fast shipping. Item was also well packed
"The delivery is Super fast. I ordered yesterday, I received it today Yet to try. "
"I like the color and I can adjust the length of the rope. The rope slowly twists while jumping then I have to straighten it again. But considering the price, I guess it’s ok. Thank you for the fast delivery."
got during flash deal and the delivery was very fast (less than days) 
"Item was well received! Delivery was quick, and item was nicely packaged. Thank you for the deal, will recommend to others :)"
"Rigorer Training Skipping Ropes, good quality and free delivery! Suitable for us ! "
Fast delivery and easy transaction and would be happy dealing with seller again.
Received my order today ..super fast delivery ordered yesterday came today...thanks
Good. Glad that I got it on a flash deal;
Product received in well packed condition. Good quality. Value for money.
Item is in good condition. It's more towards speed rope as compared to the weighted ones. Overall good purchase :)
It's made of good material and in light weight. Thank you!
Great rope!
Delivery was incredibly fast. Item came in nicely packed and in perfect condition. 
bought the  blue one! its good and was delivered fast. appreciate it!
"Delivery took some time, might be due to Covid 19. Have not tried yet, materials seem good. "
Order received as expected and delivered on time. Works really well.
"Received in good condition and despite COVID19, the item arrive quite fast! "
Delivery and shipping was quick which is great! But I shouldn’t have gotten this version its quite uncomfortable especially if you’re not used to it because the wires get wrapped around the handle when you’re skipping but on the plus side you can probably change the handles to weighted handles
Item received in good condition and fast delivery :) 
Very fast delivery 
Delivery was a bit slow probably due to being sent by normal post. Works well and easy to use 
item received in good package and condition..delivery is fast..haven’t try hopefully it’s good product
The skipping rope works fine. Just that the delivery takes a longer while to arrive. 
"Nice quality, would recommend!"
Order well received in good condition and delivery time is relatively fast.
Order is as described. Delivery is fast. Overall satisfied for this price point. Good buy. 
"Great product that I got during a sale, for only $0.99! Value for money "
"Really like the quality of the rope, but haven't had one where the rope is heavier than the handles."
Very light but not like those kid's jump rope. Good for training and speed.
"The rope is not as flexible as nylon, and at this price I'll accept this quality."
"Not bad, good quality. Fast delivery as well.just nice for cb"
Received item in good condition:) just only that shipping too a little longer. Probably due to the covid 19 issue. Personally I prefer the black steel wire ones.
"Good skipping rope, nothing to complain about. Got it at flash deal. Might have cheaper ones out there since made in China."
Rope is light and can be used easily. Seems durable and can be washed. 
Fast delivery. Parcel received 2 days after purchased.
Received after 7 days upon payment. Light rope. Overall is good.

Light and bright colour. The kids love it. Thanks
Awesome. Tks 
Awesome item. Def value for money! 
Delivered as described. Good quality and easy to adjust length of the rope. Great addition to workout during this period
feels like a cheap skipping rope not worth like $7+ that i paid.  can get cheaper better ones. 
Super fast delivery. Love that it is very lightweight! The colour is nice too!!
Fast delivery but handle seems very thin and fragile but worth it for the price

"Received in good condition, plastic envelope from local seller in 7 days by Singpost normal. Has yet to try. "
You need to take note of the thickness so to sure to get what you need
Shipping took a week. I really like this band and is perfect for my workout. It is stretchable and won't snap easily. Would buy more! :)
"Works as advertised, very pleased with the buy, will purchase again "
Bought the red and yellow one. Resistance is soso but band will ride up and twist by itself when you’re exercising. Will not recommend. 
"Good, thank you"
Fast delivery with good use. The band tend to fold when exercise but if wearing tights there is no issues 
"Very good resistance esp the black one, cant wait to use it! Quite fast delivery, quality seems quite good too "
Great material. Stretchy. Love the item!! Worth the money and price !!!!!
"Order came shortly after ordering, item is well packaged and delivered."
Items came as described. Feels quite legit with very good tension. Its a good buy for the price! 
Received in two weeks times.. Quality seems ok.. Yet to try. 
Hope it last...dont break ok
really good for shaping the hip muscles and it’s really stiff. might not be suitable for hip thrusters
good quality :-) smells a bit funny but that’s expected 
"Rubber smell too strong, "
Not bad I tried it alr can feel the resistance and it seems quite durable !! Hopefully it will be during a workout too ! But came quite fast ! Thanks 
Fast delivery. Well received. Worth the money. Yet to try but the material is okay.
Item received in order !!
Items received in good order. Tightness of respective bands is obvious.
Its great 
Received it safely. Took around 10 days. Haven't try but looks okay 
"Received item as shown on picture. Bought during flash sale, quick delivery. "
Very nice and stretchable!! Hope it is durable and can last!!
Bought one of each as a present for my friend but havent been able to pass it to him due to the covid situation packaging is good delivery was fast !
Received in order
Order well received. Items nicely packed. Delivery is fast. Missing another yellow 
"Received all items in good condition, haven't try yet. Hope is really useful. "
"Received my black resistance band from my mailbox yesterday. Was really excited to open it because it was so affordable. There’s a strong rubbery smell to it, hopefully it will subside as i start using it. Elasticity seems good, hopefully it won’t break when in midst of using"
Bought during flash sale at only 99 cents. Item received in order.
2nd time purchasing as my blue one broke..
It took quite a while to receive the resistant band. The quality is good and value for money.
Intensity was accurate in terms of the strength it stated. Cheap and work well.
Received in order but yet to use it so not sure about the strength
Ordered before. it is ok
Items received in good condition. Hope it spur me to exercise. Yet to test out. Thanks. 
Received in good conditions
Item as described. 1 week from order to delivery. Thank you seller 
Product is as expected. Arrived in reasonable time and there is difference in tension between the two colours. Would recommend
"Purchase the medium resistance band, it is thin and not sure if able to withstand high pressure/resistance exercise. Nonetheless the product came in good condition! "
Fast delivery. Item quality okay. Good good good good good.
Yet to try. But it was well packaged. Seems good enough for price paid. 
quality is great & shipping was relatively fast despite it being the COVID 19 period!!! 
Item as described. Quality so so but you get what you pay~...
Ordered on Jun 6 and received on Jun 15 in good condition 
Great item Thank u for the prompt service
Happy with the product. Delivery took quite sometime but its okie. 
The product quality is ok for the price paid and delivery time is acceptable 
good! i like the resistance that the yellow one provides !! came quite late (more than a week) but it is understandable due to current situation :) overall satisfied
"arrived faster than expected, quality of product = average "
Received item in good order. Yet to use it but should be ok...
Came as described. All have good resistance. The red one in particular has a very strong rubber smell compared to the yellow and blue. 
Items received and quality seems tally to wat I expected (medium strength) however it took almost 2 weeks to arrive 
"The product does smell and feels very weird at first . Should clean it before using.   But overall gets the job done for working out, it's cheap. "
"item arrived 11 days after ordering, seems good, have yet to test band"
Good quality but slow delivery.
Tried using it and seems really good and effective in toning the body!! 
Good. Would be great to include the strength on the strap.
Quality feels good hopefully doesn’t tear when using. 
Ok for the price 
Abit worries the “extra light” band will tear as the quality are really really thin. Like the red (heavy) one. 
Looks legit. 
Received items well packed
Items arrived in good condition and earlier than expected
"not bad, quite good wish that it was longer but it’s really good, also I really scared that the red one will snap but it seems pretty good "
Shipping was pretty fast. Quality feels pretty good for the $0.99 flash sale!
"Good quality bands, I recommend."
"the bands are much smaller than expected tbh, and feels like it'd snap of i use it"
Cheap. Decent quality. Shipping take around 1 week. Not bad 
Packaging arrived in letterbox promptly. Thank you seller
Great buy! Cheap and is very useful for training arms. Highly recommended. Thank you seller!
"received in individual packaging. not too sure if it works, havent try yet"
Items reach faster than expected as ship from China. Hope it last
Just received these workout tools. Items inside the small envelope in good condition. Quality not bad. We can use them in oir next workout. Recommended. 
"Received item in good condition, but the smell of rubber still very strong even after been washed."
Delivery waiting time was average. Item received well packaged. Enjoyed the product as it is what i expected. Will definitely recommend this seller as it was a smooth and easy transaction. The communication was clear. Looking forward for my next purchase. Thank you seller............................
Items well-received. Seller took the effort to ensure items were well protected from damages via delivery. Highly recommended seller. 
Order received in good condition. Tried the black one and the resistance is really good. Highly recommend for those looking for good home workouts.
Good quality of resistance bands expect for the smell...
Tore on the 4th day of using... sad :(
"Great elasticity and resistance, great buy, very worth :)"
Product is of good quality and came as described. Satisfied with my purchase.
Goood quality!!!!!! Really like it!!!! Fast delivery!!!! 
"it is quite short, and not very strong. but good quality thanks!"
Condition look good and the delivery was very fast too. Will definitely consider buying next time. 
Bought during the flash sales quite affordable. However it’s damn short like can just put over my forehead like a headband??
Bad quality  Quite thin Not what I expected  Request for cancel order they refused to Then wasted my money 
Is ok
Material is good. 0.9 is quite intense. Will see if I can keep up with it! 
Received my parcel in fast delivery thanks 
"Received in good condition. Delivery was fast too, Thank you! "
"Worth the money, only no indication of the resistance. Fast delivery "
As promised 
Mom said it was good for her exercise.
"Love it, though I wish it came in different colours   Smells funky - had to soak in soap before the rubber smell fades off. "

"Fast delivery, did not expect it to come so quickly. Nice bottle, will buy again."
Next day door-to-door delivery! Item is bulky (about 9cm diameter x 21cm height) as compared to Tupperware 1L bottle (taller but smaller diameter). The cap seals well.
Fast delivery within 3 days and came well protected. Have tried washing it in dishwasher and it works so should be original. 
Very patient and responsive seller.  Verfied color before sending as the color I wanted was out of stock. Item came in good condition.  Will recommend this seller.
Ok not bad.
Received in good condition. Started to use but have plastic smell. 
Super fast delivery. Lovely water bottle. Will definitely buy again. 
My family love it.. 
Received in 5 days but understandable due to the circuit breaker situation hence expect a delay in shipment. Product Received as advertised with no scratches. 
Very fast delivery just a day after ordering. Great deal after usiñg shopee coins to offset.
"very swift delivery, chose local/domestic because we needed it urgently, will get more in future. good quality from Nalgene"
Cadet colour is out of stock so seller asked me to choose another colour. Cute as well 
"Got this today. Quick delivery. My first choice was cadet because the color is so beautiful. Too bad seller texted me saying that it is out of stock - so in the end, chose trout green. Anyway, still prefer cadet color. Thanks seller for informing me on the color availability. "

FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYY RECEIVED MY ITEM. Shipping and delivery takes a long time. However product is in good condition. Not bad.

"Bought the Lavender L but it’s too loose for glutes workout. Beginners who want to train the glutes, can consider getting size M, unless your thighs are too big to fit into the size M band. "

Happy with product. No issues. 
Bought it as a gift for a friend. Another friend of mine bought this and recommended it to me. Great texture that doesn't shift on your skin mid-workout
"second time ordering as the first time i ordered, the item didn’t come but i had a full refund. the bands are super sturdy and a lot of resistance which is good. they don’t look like they would tear easily."
"First time order, not sure how is the quality so I order 1pc only.  And—I’m happy with my order! item come with well packaging. Quality is good ,really thick and tight,  cute pink colour too! Highly recommended, I Definitely will order again !"
received in good condition! quality doesn’t seem too bad though it’s a little tight for me
"Delivery took around 1 week, really fast. The material is really sturdy and it has an inner anti slip. Seller also sent a card with well wishes! Only sad thing is that this product sends by the variations by random, I really wanted the other purple one which has a pastel hue to it :)"
"Very good product quality, stretchable but also provide high resistance at the same time "
Great water bottle in nice colour 
fast delivery
super fast deliver and good bottle 
Very fast delivery! I just paid yesterday and I received it today ! The product is also in good condition

I ordered on 30 June and it came on 8 July! Quality is Super good and works well! 
"Great product. I like that it doesn’t ride up when you’re doing exercises. Feels nice on the skin, good quality. 2nd time purchasing. "
Decent quality and overall a pleasant purchase except for a little waiting time..  The rest are good too.. Purchased around 5 items in total... 
Receive item in good condition..quality looks promising!

Items received in good condition. Quality is good. 
Item is super sturdy! Highly recommended!
Good quality 
Received item in good condition after a week since purchased. Bought the purple and it is true to photo. 
Good product at great value 
"Quality is good and thick, looks like it can last long. BTW, this is the Large size resistance band."
"Fast delivery,have not try out yet ."
Solld ! I will buy again
Not much elastic to move around 
"Very resisting, very thick and feels steady! Thanks ;)!!!!"
Extremely good quality I especially love the non slip strips inside. Good resistance for my beginner level
Good quality. 
This for begginers. If you want resistance you have to buy something else. Good quality. 
Love the resistance band. Has black non slip material at the inside of the band. The resistance good enough for a workout. Material is cotton synthetic fibre as indicated in the packaging. Satisfied with the purchase
The colour is really pretty!!  Inside also have one elastic band to prevent it from slipping!! Really great buy!!
Quality is good for its price! Love the colours of the band - Size L works fine for me but I feel that M may be better 
"good quality, delivery was fast and efficient, exact to pic"
Really high quality. Don’t get anything smaller than an L! Will purchase again.
Like the colour! Got the M size and it’s quite interesting when added to workout. May purchase the S one to feel greater resistance. 
"Fast delivery, received in good condition, material is good, satisfied with purchase  Will purchase  again. "
"nice material!, came in a good packaging & wasn’t as stretchable but it’s good for leg workouts not really for arm!! looks exactly like the picture shown & high quality! shipping was fast too! seller was very nice & thoughtful, there is a note!! highly recommended!"
Awesome and nice colour
Received with thanks! Packed in a nice plastic to protect the product.
Really pretty and comfortable. Has anti slip ridges on the inner side. Washing instructions also given at the back of the packaging. Looks small at first but fits perfectly and just enough tension for beginners
Just received! Good quality. Yet to try the bands to put it to test. :)
"I got size M and not stretchable which Is why 3 stars:(( it’s just a thick band, no stretch. Good quality feel tho "
Received in good condition. Tested and the elasticity is good 
Wrong color
"Haven’t tried it yet, but looks like a good quality one. Thank you "
Responsive and friendly CS
Received in good condition. Material is good 
Look decent. Yet to try
"Ordered on the 3rd of June, received on the 10th of June. There's little to none elasticity and it feels very rigid. Maybe it would've worked better if I bought one of those larger sizes. "
"M is too tight for me but L is also too loose for me, wish there was smth in between! but gd material and seller was nice to include note"
"Really good resistance, non-slip as well. Highly recommend! Id say pay a little more and invest in this rather than get those cheap $1 rubber ones you see all over shopee. Its worth it!"
"Well received, material of band was quite good. Delivery was fast as well. Comes with little note which was a nice touch! "
Was packed well and the mat and yoga block were really good! The resistance band looked really sturdy! Would definitely recommend it. 
Yay received my fitness squat band! Can’t wait to train my thighs and ass to look fit and sexy.
a darker pink compared to pictures but works wells and stretches well
Nice colour. Delivery was pretty fast. Received in about 1+ weeks. 
Band came with ziplock bag to keep  ITS SUPPPERRRRR DUPERRR hard to pull Apart. Thickk n gd quality
"Items took a while to arrive which was expected under current situation.  Despite that the seller had wrapped up the package, the boxes were badly dented but the items were intact.  Thanks seller(s)!"
First time take M but too small for me so order L again   Good to used. fast delivery and received in 6 days only. Love it 
"works really well in giving resistance during workout. however, for the plus sized girls out there, i agree with previous buyers in that maybe size L could be more suitable. "
"Item delivered as described, thank youuuu!"
expected delivery to take longer but item arrived in just a week. Good quality. 
"Should have seen the resistance and weight value (for me, 52kg weight value for a 45kg female is very tight). Maybe it will loosen after a while. Other than that colour is beautiful and product is great! "
"It was better than what I have expected! Despite the price, but the quality exceeds your expectations. Recommended! "
"Super fast delivery. You want 5 stars, i will give you 5 stars :)"
"item came in good condition, satisfied purchase. will use it!"
Good quality resistance band but it is not for beginner. The resistance is quite strong. 
"Nice and Good quality and packeging!I love it And also the letters,Thank you Will purchase again for my sister:)"
"Delivered after 1 week, size just right for me and nice colour "
Product came in good condition and was well wrapped up! Comfortable and sturdy. Difference between the M and L bands is quite big. Pictures attached for reference.
second buy! great material 
Have not used it but the packing is good . 
Delivery was around 3 weeks. The item got several dirty spot and mold. Otherwise it is acceptable. 
"Good quality product, but delivery could be faster"
"Received in good condition! Both the bands do provide resistance, but the purple one is tighter. Partly because I got it one size smaller, but the band also seems more dense and solid. Would recommend! "
The material is thick and of good quality !  Suitable for home workout. Will definitely recommend to friends !
Good quality for the price. Bought large and quite tight but very good for legs and thigh exercises. 
shipment took a while but overall not too bad quality. good amount of resistance; great for home training!
good quality!! does provide resistance as well! overall good product 
Received in good condition &  the quality looks goodHave yet not tried hopefully its good.
Good quality.  Should listen to seller’s hint on the size... of buy again will go for offer size. 
good quality. cant wait to use. shld hv gotten M but it is okay! 
Great quality but delivery took about 2 weeks. Just enough resistance for my liking. Will definitely order again. 
Love it. The product is in good condition and the quality is good. I will purchase again.
Items received ard 1 week. Band is proper packed inside a reusable zip lock bag Quality and feel is good. Colour is nice too. Will order it again if I need more diff sizes. Thanks 
In good condition
"Smells quite bad. My fingers feel powdery after touching the resistance bands.   Just tried it, the resistance is not bad i think it would be fine after washing the bands. Would buy it again in the future."
Item is received in good condition. Delivery is within the week. Looks like good quality. Happy with the purchase
 Received earlier than expected. Really love this colour!!
Good quality for the price paid. Can’t wait to use it for my workouts! 
"(Left to right: M, L, XL) So for anyone who can’t read the Chinese chart... M provide the most resistance, XL provides the least resistance!   Quality is great for price paid and delivery time was decent. Definitely recommend if you want something cheap and doesn’t take up floor space. "
Fast delivery. Despite covid
Good! Tight and comfortable. Perfect for squats. Diff from elastic band! Worth the purchase! 
"Really nice, have yet to try :)"
packaged really well. love the colour!
Good quality but too small for me. Have to order bigger size. 
"Good condition! Tight just the way I wanted it. Thanks!! Looks good quality.   Just a warning to beginners to avoid M, start with L/XL! I was quite shocked when I first used it. "
received in great condition and very satisfied with purchase. 
Product received in good condition 
"Good quality, the size is just nice, colour is true to picture too. Worthy purchase!"
Good quality fitness band. Love using it. 
Good quality! Ordered 2 and both came packaged nicely. Band is thick and provides good resistance. Won’t snap easily! 
Bought the L size and the resistance is just nice.
"Fast delivery! Quality is good, doesnt feel flimsy. "
good! 
Delivery takes a while but band seems to be of good quality. Almost bought a SG brand one at $25 glad this is only $5+. I tried it out and does provide resistance. 
The quality is actually really good!!!! Doesnt ride up either :))
"Received in about two weeks. Love the quality. So much better than the rubber ones from decathlon. Both size are good, suitable for doing different intensity workout. "
"Good quality product at reasonable price, but I've chosen too small the size which is too tight for me."
My girl is super excited to finally receive the item. Came in good condition but delivery took awhile. But overall satisfied with my purchase.
Received in good condition. Comfortable and working well so far.
Saw a lot of good reviews have yet to open.. hope to try it soon. Hehehe
Well packaged. Super high quality! The interior has some form of grip (grey part is rubber). Highly recommend! Will repurchase again
Good quality. Better than those rubber bands as this doesn’t slip around.
super fast delivery only took 4 days. band is strong and sturdy with non slip inner lining but material will probably soak up the sweat  
Good quality! Definitely worth the price and the parcel came faster than expected! Will definitely repurchase from seller again!
Received item after 1 week plus. The quality of the material is great.
Arrived in about 2 weeks as expected during this period. But well packed and works well! Good price too!
Product well received! 
Good quality and nice color
good quality and resistance! Just that it is a lil tight for me 
Love these! Good quality for a cheap price! Great buy!  Received after almost a month of waiting but it's understandable due to the Covid-19 Pandemic
Good material and the elasticity resistance is considered good quality. Delivery is a bit longer may be due to the current situation right now. Recommended! 
Love the color! The resistance is definitely there and it’s abit tight for me. 
Order received quite long as expected due to CB but the quality is good for its price. Also the seller send letter and a cute freebie. Will use this later. Thanks
Good quality at an amazing price! Thank u :) 
Received them in good condition.
Very durable and stretchy! Non slip is really good for workouts. 
"Place order and received within 9 days include a SG public holiday where the postman is not working which is considered very fast delivery! I am very happy with the resistance band, great texture, elasticity is jus nice for beginners to intermediate level. The colour is purple & nice band width 4 al"
Item came in perfect condition. Material is prerty good quality and definitely more than worth it for this price range.  Love it!! Update: can't express how much I love this product after using it in my workout! 
"Products took 1 week to arrive which is pretty decent since it’s shipped from overseas. The bands however, has a different stretch. The purple band is tighter than the cyan one."
Fast delivery!!! 
Quality very good but too tight . I find it too tight to move my legs and arms. It is not that elastic enough. 
"Delivery came much earlier than expected! The band is a lot wider than it seems, and the quality is good!"
Items were well packaged and of very good quality. I am very impressed and excited to try them out :) 
super good quality! honestly very very satisfied w the item!! would recommend
Received in good condition!! And it’s much better than normal band!! Really like it. Delivery took sometime but still acceptable!!
Received in good condition and resistance is good n strong...
Items received in around 2 weeks. Blue in M was sold out but pink is pretty too. Tried the bands and they work very well!
Came well wrapped and though thickness of mat is just nice for me.   
Fast delivery and quite a good quality!!! 
the band is too tight. i bought M and i have to use my whole body force to even stretch it out a little bit. 
Item is in good condition. Very high resistance band. May not be very suitable for beginners.
"Gd quality,  fast delivery. Nice pink colour."
Fast delivery ty 
"true to image, non-slippery and good material! defo worth the price "
"Item as per picture, quality is pretty good as well. Thanks for the card!!"
Delivery takes awhile but still good. The material and quality seems good. Good feel I think its quite worth it! 
Quality looks good and item received within a week.
decent quality but doesnt stretch as well. this means i cant use it for most exercises ): 
product received well packaged and colour is really pretty and exact to the picture. band is more resistant than i expected 
"not bad, tried it and it works perfectly good! amazing thankyou "
This time round delivery took forever. Other than that seller is nice to respond and explain just that maybe seller could explain earlier so that I wouldn’t be waiting unnecessarily as I’m ok to change colour
"Item well received via normal mail... Useful and nice color bands, good for workout that can be done at home. Thanks"
Great quality just from my first impression!
love the quality it doesnt feel cheap 
Item came after a while but product looks pretty legit thank you so much 
Product quality better than expected! Shipping is quite fast considering current situation :) 
New batch are from different brand  and colours aren’t Pastel anymore . A few of them came without packaging. Hopefully it will restock again . 
Nice drun
"I got this in size L and it feels just right, not too tight, suitable to use for training."
"Delivery took a while. Bought the wrong size I think although I based it from the weight chart, but it's too big for me. I just appreciate the letter from the seller. Quality looks ok. "
Good quality 
"received in good condition, shipping was ok considering covid19 thanks "
product true to picture and the material seems good! cant wait to try it
Received in great condition! :-)
Band is thick and good quality but has a weird smell so have to wash it before using. 
"haven't tried it yet but material seems good, hopefully it is durable as well :)"
Received in good condition. A size smaller would be better to have more resistance and tension for exercise.
"the bands are really good quality and the seller is super nice, they messaged me to lmk one of the colours was out of stock and allowed me to change :)"
"there’s a smell, but the resistance is good!! It’s thick and strong :)"
Item is same as picture shown. Good material. Took 2 weeks to reach me but no issues. Will try out and hope it works
"Product received in good condition! The elasticity is just nice, great for beginner/intermediate hip exercises :) "
Colours are really pretty!!! And of course they work really well! Seller is very nice and quick to send out another one because it got lost the first time. Thank youuuu :-)
Product was secured tightly in a packaging and it does not ride up when doing exercise! Highly recommend 
Very good

Impressive!! Very fast delivery!! 
Delivery took 8 days. Items true to photos and quality is good. Thanks!
Value for money. Doesn’t slip when using it.
Got the Medium size but I think I should have gotten L. The resistance is good though.  Just a comment that the item has a very strong chemical scent when you first open it.
Couldn’t get the light blue colour I wanted but V strong resistance 
"Material feels good! Works well, will definitely purchase again. "
Good stretch and non slip band.
Just receive the items. Ordered one M and one XL. The material is good and tight. Like the colour too! Excited to try it soon 
"Very good quality for this price, can't wait to use it! "

good quality for the price

"Re-purchased, got a slight discount thanks to seller. Delivery took about a week this time, much faster. Pleasant transaction (: "
Got this in XL as I am plus sized although I think an L would’ve been better for me. It has relatively good resistance.
"Order came surprisingly fast, given the situation. It's in good quality. Thank you :)"
"good quality!!!! value for money, inside has rubber layer for resistance "
"Item well received, true to photo and works really well!"
item received in good condition. colour is more towards green than cyan. some loose threads but feels sturdy. tested it out & resistance level is high. may not be suitable for beginners.

"received in great condition. seems good quality, was packaged well too"
Great product for the cheap price! Delivery took quite a while due to Covid seller was nice in replying my enquiries!! Would purchase again (: 
A little sad because the pink is more towards neon pink instead of pale pink.  Delivery took about 2 wks but understandable due to current situation. Overall okay. 
Looks good

It is too tight
"Pretty solid product given the price point. Thick and sturdy band that should be quite long lasting. First time working with a thick band, im not sure if there's diff resistance level but looks like I would get a good workout out of it. Pretty high resistance level, should be good for glutes "
"Fast delivery! Nice and thick, good for strengthening my legs "
the quality is really good for its price! delivery is efficient despite the covid 19 situation!
It’s in amazing condition and very good packaging

"Good quality, love it!"
"love the colour, just tried it out for an exercise and boy it helped with the resistance!! defo will purchase again! :) "
Similar to the photos! Looks good! Cant wait to test and try it out!
Tetsed it. Quality is good. Only thing is the rubber smell is strong.
Quality stuff at a reasonable price. It stretches really well and is internally lined with rubber to prevent slipping. Great buy and i love the color. 100% will purchase again!
"slow delivery, product is just so so, good for beginner who wants to try new equipment "
Good Material.
It’s really good quality nuff said JUST GET IT
Fast delivery and the ring is useful for me 
Seller originally sent out the wrong order but immediately messaged me and rectified it. Very pleasant exchange and interaction! Will give more stars if I could. I really like the TPE mat. thanks for the great service! 
"Super happy with this mat!! Pretty pink colour, comes w 2 bands to secure the mat tgt and bag for me to put the mat in!"
YES I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I love the colour! I love the texture( tho there are some dents) its thick and foamy! I love! A good purchase for the first yoga mat i have:)
Good quality as this is my second buy. Thick enough to absorb impact. Just that mat tend to slip when u doing big movements such as jumping and dancing. So need to place the rough portion of the mat against the floor.
Yoga mat of good quality! Love the size and the thickness. Thanks seller
"comfortable, comes with the black bag to store the mat."
"Good quality, worth the buy! Finally don’t need an extra towel for me knees"
Received fast in good condition. With black carrier. Thank you!
Like the pink. Quality looks good and it’s thick. Thanks seller!
"overall material is quite good. but i am disappointed about the thickness, it is only 7mm. although it did mention 1 to 2mm different, but mine is 3mm lesser. due to i have knee cap problem, i wish to get 10mm thickness yoga mat. i"
Excellent product. No defects. Thickness is exact as stated.very comfy!!! 
Strong and wide and thick. Very worth the money indeed. Thanks. 
Really pretty shade of pink  Tried exercising on it once and so far so good
"True to size and picture.  Have used it for my exercise and yoga, it does the job.  No complains for a simple yoga mat.  It is not slip-proof so be careful. The material can be quite slippery when wet. Give it a simple wipe after each usage to keep clean. "
"Does not look as good as the picture online, has some dents. Hope it can last! Thanks for the delivery. "
Good material.. thick but the bottom of the mat a bit slippery will move about
"well received. thank you, seller (:"
Item came as described. It is well packaged.                 Size is good and thickness is 8mm.                             Tried and slippery when wet. Need to put hand towel to break the slipperiness. Overall still serve the purpose as an exercise mat.                   Waiting time is acceptable.
Came well packaged. Has its own bag for easy storage and carriage. Also came with 2 straps to help secure both ends of mat so can put into bag easily. Good buy! 
Have yet to lay out the mat flat but so far it looks promising! Good thickness. Seems quite lightweight. Cant fit the provided bag though cos it's too big hahaha. Came in good package. Thanks seller!
"Well recieved.  Fast delivery. Nice colour, quality feels great, thick enough for proper support, non slip too. Come with a storage bag. Happy with the purchase."
"Thick and definitely of good quality, larger than the usual size.. Providing very good support for the spine. "
"Item was well received, was good to have 2 bands and a carrier bag to hold and bring the mat around, and love the thickness. However the mat width was shorter than expected and it has an oily feel, which makes the mat slippery. "
Good quality & pricing. Delivered in 2 weeks despite virus situation  
Thickness is ok. Have not try whether it’s anti slip. Delivery waiting  is ok. Got free bag. Overall happy w the purchase  
"The thickness is 7 mm, not 10 mm as advertised. I believe i’m the third person to say this in a review! It is relatively non-slip even on a ceramic tile floor.  "
"Delivery not too long. Not as thick as advertised (about 6-7mm only instead of 10mm), but still fine."
"Bought on behalf, for other purpose. Received in good order."
Love the pink mat. Like that it comes with 2 elastic band to hold the mat and a bag too!!
Thick and suitable for home use as it will be bulky to bring out. scratch with marks if not careful.  Very comfortable but it will move if do strenuous activities. 
happy with the purchase! definitely one of the lowest price here in shoppee and with good quality! gambled on ordering the TPE type on one of my  purchase (my roommate ordered NBR) because mostly order the NBR but I am more satisfied with the quality of the TPE coz it feels more durable! 
"Very happy with the packaging and quality. It's so thick and spongy, cant wait to use it"
good quality!! its almost 3 times thicker than my old one! very happy
the mat came well-wrapped and is in good condition! the color is accurate to picture and its quite comfy too huhu j think is very worth its price
Love the mat esp the color. Super worth it 
Ordered Pink color but got Purple with no notice from the seller. Material is nice and as described. Thick foam with bag and strap. Delivery time is within given time frame. 
Received the yoga mat and straps but missing mesh bag. Seller unable to provide mesh bag but gave minor compensation. 
Fast delivery. Not yet open my parcel.
just received today. look as expected.  looking forward to try.
Is quite soft... not really non-slip... jus like it cos is wide enough.... but will not buy again...
"item well received. seems a little light, have yet to try it."
"Quite happy with my mat. I like the purple, thick enough, spongey. Hope it remains non slip if I sweat. Thanks! "
Omg! i am very happy with my new yoga mat.. what you see is what you get.. thanks seller for this wonderful product.. gonna enjoy it! 
"I am a very happy customer. Haven’t Unwrapped it yet but it looks good, quite thick (with support) and I love the colour! Much better purchase than the previous mat I ordered from another shop which was easily torn. "
"Quality not bad, will buy again. "
"Item well received. The material is good. There’s no rubber smell. Thank you, Seller. "
Light weight mat and quite thin. Good to come with net bag
Nice and I just try.
Item received in good packaging. Hope its as god as advertised 
Item was almost a single bed size mattress! Received with good condition n it was thick.
Smell of the mat is super strong! Can faint
The mat is thick wide and comfortable BUT Please note under surface is smooth. So you need a carpet or another rough rug below.  
Received with good condition. 
Received in good condition and fast delivery. 
not too bad but no grip on the floor
Not really good quality. Not non slip. 
Like the thickness and support the yoga mat provides to support my back. It has some odour and needs to air. 
"Thanks Seller. Received item in good condition. Feels great and love the color. Item also came with 2 rubber straps, good! "
Bought for wife.. it is thick she like it. 
Fast delivery and good quality mats. The mat is soft as the rubbery smell not as strong as I expected it to be. It even comes with a bag and 2 elastic bands for the mats. Worth the price. Satisfied with the purchase. Will definitely recommend getting from this shop. 
"Doesn't come with any mesh bag, just 2 rubber bands.. Measured the width and is only ard 8mm,not 10mm as advertised.. But for the price i guess is still worth it"
"Prompt delivery. Quality is not bad, a little soft though and it comes with a bag."
"Comes with a holder bag for the mat, quality exactly as described in the photos. Delivery is quite speedy considering the fact that it was shipped from China. Thanks! :)"
Second time buying. Delivery was prompt and item came in good condition
Ok. First time ordered. Very soft. Not bad
"The thickness and the size is great. However it is no adhesive enough. During workout and yoga, the mat will shift place. Thou it is really very comfortable compare to regular yoga mat. But adhensiveness is off"
Very happy with purchase. Good buy for this price. 
Mat come in good order 
Items received in good condition & fast. Very cool & good quality too. My daughter loves it so much. Thank you so much. 
Bought 2 yoga mats. Very good in terms of thickness and the mats came in good condition without any scratches and dent. Cheaper than those selling in shops. Worth to buy. 
"Product received in ok quality, have a few cuts here and there, probably due to poor packaging and delivery took very long, more than 3 weeks.  "
Good thickness. Delivery quite long but finally hsbc delivered by Roadbull. Good thickness and comes with a huge mesh bag that I can also put towel in it 
10mm? Only 8mm... 
"Didn’t expect quick delivery within a week. Received in good condition, only slight dent due to the firm strap used around the mat for delivery. Thickness and length is just nice. Already used for my workout and it was worth it! "
Good quality  
Hmmm quite a strong smell initially but it’s fine after airing.
"Great purchase no regrets! No issues when delivered as well. Only that the delivery was given to me at 10pm, apart from that everything looks amazing :) will recommend!!!"
Ordered on 2 June and received it today. Mat is very soft. Has some chemical smell but shouldn’t be a problem after a few days. Has a few scratches which not a big deal for me. Has rubber bands to hold the mat and a carrier. Haven’t tried working out so not sure about the non slip but so far so good
Great delivery man 
Ok my fat ass wanted to buy this to workout but im just too lazy but i guess the thickness and length is just nice for me to nua on it
Love the baby pink mat
Good Product. Delivery took some time but it is understandable because of the situation. Thanks.
"Strange, the purple is taller than the pink? It's supposed to be the same size"
Item received in good condition. Yet to try but material looks ok. 
Well received. Good size. Thick. 
Item received in good condition however it is not entirely anti-slip after some intense workout.
"Took less than 2 weeks to arrive. Thank you seller.  Mat arrived well packed. But probably due to the thickness and packing, the edges of the mat was a little compressed. Mat may be a little slippery as the reverse side is smooth. Overall, still a good buy given the size, thickness and carrier."
Product is really good. It's not slippery and it doesn't not move when working out. Its a little smelly when arrived and had to be air dried.
Late delivery. Worth buying.
"Finally it’s here, I put a request to cancel but seller already courier out so I decided to accept it. Quality is good, light weight compare to the 6mm thin mat and given 2 free black band to hold it after you roll up. "
Thick and comfortable. Fast delivery too.
"Product just as it is shown. Very big, very happy with the size. Nice color too. However when I do high impact exercise on it, the rubber tear a little.  But overall not that bad. Thou It’s difficult to keep due to the bulky size but I use it as playing mat for daughter when I am not use using it."
Thickness is about 12mm. Not 15mm. Width is slightly less than 90cm.  It comes with a carrying case and two rubber straps. 
Yoga mat received. Thanks seller. Yoga mat come with bag and holder. Very nice
Quality is okay . waiting time is a little long due to covid 19 situation. However everything is good .worth the price I guess. 
"Item received after 2 weeks. Item as advertised, thick and good. Quite bulky so not as easy to keep in the bag. The bag has a torn portion as shown in the picture."
"Came with the bag and 2 X rubber band . Length is suitable but looks fragile ,like it's gonna break easily. Just try to handle with care and see how it goes. Otherwise,it's great for this price that comes with a bag which other stores charge an additional price for it."
It looks bigger than what i expected(maybe because i never measured myself). The material is soft and it’s not that bad. Given a bag to roll it up too. 
"Received 12 days after order. Comes w/ 2 black elastic ties (to secure rolled up mat), a black drawstring bag to store. Gd quality despite a few scratch marks (which will eventually happen anyway). New mat smell got better after airing. New mat is slippery so wipe surface thoroughly before use. "
"Item received in good condition. Material slightly soft, but acceptable for a price like that."
Other den that is ok!
This is huge. Had a difficult time keeping it after i opened it but it is comfortable. Hopefully it is good for my HIIT
"No anti slip, i kept slipping.material also too hard and it might hurt posture quite painful on my head when i lie down"
"Love the colour of the yoga mat. Better than Watsons' mats in terms of price, colour. If it's thicker, would be the best. "
Item received in good condition. Yoga Mat is thick however it’s a bit slippery for intense workout. 
Has a super strong rubbery smell. Hope it goes away after a few uses. 
Very slippery underside. But good cushioning and support. 
Decent delivery time. Overall good quality as expected for the price. 
Quality soso only
Nice!
Received items in good condition. Not yet to try. Think it’s worthwhile to buy the bigger size than the small ones if don’t have carry it around.
received in good condition. will use it for home exercises. 
It’s thick and light pink as shown in pictures. 
"Material is light and soft and does not absorb sweat/water which is good but can be slippery. The underside of the mat is slippery as well. But for this price, you cannot complain much."
Good for workout quite thick and reasonable size and good price for this size. 
Thickness ok but many ‘dents’ marks on the mat.
Received my mat today.  Delivery was timely. Good buy. Thanks. 
"Ordered 8 June, received 15 June 2020. Due to the wrapping, the  mat was torn as shown in pictures.  Mat is narrow and long but acceptable for the price as it comes with bag and 2 tightening straps. Haven't tried it out so can't comment if is a non slip mat. Thickness is fine for me. "
The mat comes in full size version 15mm thick. 
Came w 2 of that black bands and the mat bag. Quite good accessories. But still slippery on my floor. Just dun do too high intensity can liao
Thicker than 10mm. Slightly softer than expected but it provides good cushion for knees. Slight odour. Thanks. 
"Thick and soft. Though the rubber smell very strong, even after a week. "
"Received in 10 days' time. Item in good condition. Come with carrier and a pair of rubber bands for the mat. The thickness is around 7mm, less than10mm though.   "
Looks alright.  Hopefully can withstand pressure and non-slip. Thanks!
"Good size and good thickness, color is pretty too. Not much smell. Recommended! "
Parcel received but there is a knife cut on the mat. 
thanks for the mat  quite fast shipping for covid and so far no issue
Ordered 10mm but actual is 8mm. Material is like styrofoam. Hopefully can last. But the pink is pretty 
so thick will reccomemd delivery was quite fast as well !!!
Very fast delivery. But it’s not anti slip. So this is the disappointing part. But the thick version really has alot of cushion to support workout so that it doesn’t hurt your joints or back. 
Took about one week to deliver. Yet to try.  
"Item came in well packed, with bag. It feel soft and it comfortable. Will buy again if need. "
Good quality n like it . Recommended 
Less than 10mm but material is not too bad... took about 9 days to receive..
Will buy again.
Received in good condition. Bought the 15mm and it’s comfortable to lie on. But it has abit of smelly smell to it. 
Received items in good condition. Delivery took awhile but acceptable due to the current condition. Comes with the bag to store the mat as well as a strap in there to strap the mat upon opening from the plastic wrapping.
"Product is as mention, but quality is a little bit disappointing (it's foam-like) "
"1st time buy a yoga mat so not sure if it is good. For me, it is alright."
"The thickness is around 7mm to 8mm, instead of 10mm as described. Nonetheless, the overall quality is commendable, and the delivery was quick (within a week) "
The mat is pretty long and it's quite comfy. It's not really non-slip as it will still move especially when I do burpees and mountain climbers. Comes with a cover which is a plus for me.
Product all seems good.....
Did know it's so big. Not convenient to bring out if not driving. But it's very useful at home during covid. Delivery was super fast less than a week....exceed expectation considering its fr China and during Covid  time. Item came in very well. Love it
Item received. Nice light pink. Not very thick but color is nice 
"Received in 10. Days. Good, thick and wide, just nice for big size guy like me."
"Fast delivery and good quality, affordable and reasonable pricing "
Don't think it's 10mm. Around 8mm only. Felt a bit cheated and waited so long. 
"The smell quite strong, but so far ok . The material very soft."
Super love the product. Delivery time was within expectation and I love the thickness. It's like a thick foam so some lines/dents are expected but its within tolerance. Tried doing planks on it and my elbows doesnt hurt. Bigger and thicker than usual mat. Happy with my purchase n may buy another. 
"Soft and comfortable, come with straps and mesh bag. Item ordered on 28 May 2020 and delivered on 6 June 2020 from China. Overall satisfied with the quality of the product and delivery time. "
Thick mat but it was easily scratched. Seems to tear quite fast. 
"Colour true to picture and delivery was earlier than the expected date, took around 1 week"
"Well packed and mat has no rubber smell. Yet to use, so can’t comment further. Overall fast delivery, good quality and reasonable price."
Item received slowly.  The review from other buyers are true.  Good item cheapest price among other sellers.
"the yoga mat arrived super quickly considering it was shipped from overseas, the price point is really good and really super worth for the price paid, bought it for my mum so not sure if she thinks that it’s good or not but it’s really cheap  edit: my mum said it was slippery"
"Received in good condition, this is the difference between the big & small one :) Bought the big one for bigger-sized people!! Smaller one is just nice for girls up to about 170cm, otherwise it might feel short, and the width is okay as well if your shoulders are not too broad! Nice to workout on!"
Delivery is fast. Quality is not bad for its price. Comfortable as well. Not too thin either.
"Order received. Very satisfied with the purchase, the mat is thick as expected :) "
Colour true to pictures. Mat is quite lightweight. Antislip can be better. But nth much to complain about for the price. Received in about 1.5 seeks time.
"10/10 , good quality mat and is thick enough for exercise s. would probably buy again in the future if required! thank you so much:)"
"Arrived earlier than expected. Has binder and bag, well-pacakaged and worth your money. Thank you seller!"

Items received and well protected. Work as described.will go for second purchased.thanks
Item received. Soft and thick. Maybe suit for normal exercise but not really suit for those lunges or jumping jack. Mat soft but not solid. Surface slippery when doing lunges or plank. 
Perfect 
Mat is good becase ot is a met becayse its good so i wont fall when i try to fallGood matttttt 
Good for a general workout but not so good for burpees as the mat would move around 
"Items take about 2 weeks to arrive, but thats okay, i can wait! :) Love it!! :)"
"Very good quality, quite thick. No pains to the back and very good for abs exercise."
The material is like memory foam. But pretty easy to tears.
"very pleased with the item, not bad quality mat ! I think the delivery is also quite acceptable during this covid-19 & PH season"
Quality not bad given the price.
Delivery time was acceptable with current situation. Reasonably priced and quality of mat is decent. 
Very good I love it it’s so soft!!!
Arrived and very thick and comfortable  
"Ordered this 10-5-2020 & it arrived only 2-6-2020, the delivery is probably affected by the covid-19 lockdown. The product itself is ok, it doesn’t slip as stated. Generally, I think it’s a good price. "
"Good quality, however I ordered fuschia but it came in light pink."
Love it! Nicely soft and thick.

Item well received
Product material is soft and comfortable. Delivery schedule was good as well and arrived well packed. Excellent service from seller. Very responsive to queries and very helpful too! 
"The yoga mat is well- received , delivery takes about 10 days , but it’s expected during this CB period .  Items is good and value for the price . "
"Well received, worth it "
Hole was cut into the bag to fit in another product for delivery hahaha but other than that the mat is really thick and soft~
Mat is slippery.
super value for money! item was well packaged and does not have rubbery smell
Fast delivery. Packaged well. The mat was thick as described to protect knees. 
Very good and very nice useful would recommend to the others!! 
Ordered 2 items and arrived within 1 week. But they didn't bubble pack the Pedal Rally and just enclose inside the mat; thus the mat has a tear at the side and the corners were wrinkled. Does have a slight plastic smell. Anyways will wash it and air it for 2 days as instructed before use.
Item is big and thick. There is a smell on mat. Other than that it fine.
Nothing to shout about. Not for fussy buyer. Delivery was quick fast (within 10 days). Seems ok 
Great service! Mat is well received and the color os so pretty! Thanks seller
Received in good condition thank you
The yoga mat came faster than I expected and even came with a yoga bag and 2 bands for me to loop around the yoga mat when it’s rolled up! Super thoughtful of the seller  The pink colour is so pretty and I can’t wait to use it!! It’s reasonably thick as well so thank you seller!! Doesn’t slide!!
"Mat is good and no plastic smell, delivery was quite fast "
Great product good quality mat and fast delivery I like the product 
Delivery took ard 1 week..the mat is thick and comfy.. value for money..
item recieved
This mat is thick and bigger than the usual yoga mat... it is good for doing yoga but it is not suitable for doing exercise as the mat will move. 
Fast delivery and good packaging. Recommended 
Quality is pretty good. Just took a long time to deliver. Note that the 10mm portion is from the bump to the bottom. It’s not the overall thickness of the mat. But it’s thick enough for normal use 
Delivery took 10 days.  Quality of the mat is good! Will recommend it to my friends 
Delivery took quite some time but overall very satisfied with what I received will definitely buy again
"super good quality , i rly rly love it ! recommended for u guys to get it ! mine came w no defects and the straps and a bag ! thank u seller  also delievery was q fast despite covid "
Delivery time acceptable. Few scratches but not bothered with it. Good purchase. 
"colour is definitely nothing like what is shown in the listings! turned out to be darker than the baby pink images seller has put up. overall, quite disappointed with the colour. cheap for its price though. fairly soft with good cushioning. hopefully this will last! recommended only for its price! "
"Light & soft yet thick, good! Color is nice too!"
The mat came in the correct colour and as shown in the descriptions! Ordered on 24th and came today!! Good buy 
"Came with a bag, 2 bands and bubble-wrapped delivered! Very Satisfied for the price paid"
Finally is here
Super fast delivery! At first it said it would only reach on the 6th of June but it came today!! Satisfied with purchase and worth the money + it comes with a bag and elastic straps to bind the mat when it’s rolled up  and it does not slide on the floor good purchase!
Good product and come with a bag also..the mat is thick as advertised..
Really thick and comfortable! Good best! Would recommend friends to get this! 
Well packed and i love the colour. 
Very satisfied. Recommended to buy The mat really soft and thick. Very happy with the quality. Lucky to buy cheap one. Pretty and good quality. Like the picture. Bravo seller
Very nicely packed such that no damage or marks on the mat. However it is 8mm and not 10mm thick. 
"Bought a purple mat. Very comfortable when using it. Extra padding protects knees and elbows very well. It is also very affordable and super worth it. Very good, would encourage people to buy it."
"Received the mat as shown. Good packing and comes with 2 straps and a bag. Color quite nice, pink. "
Ordered the yoga mat on the 10May and received today. The colour is nice and yet to use it.
"Good quality product. Would be quite challenging to fold and store,due to its dimensions. "
"Well delivered but I wouldn't say the quality is ""good"", it is decent enough for the price i guess  Edit: feels slippery when walking on it, might only be good for stable low gravity moves"
"came in good condition, with a bag, thank you seller"
Very nice color n material is soft. Mat is narrower than usual but its fine. 
Delivery took some time. Item was light. Came with the thickness and size that I wanted as it is meant for home use. Item was bubble wrapped to protect the mat. There was also a sling bag to store the mat and two elastic bands to hold the mat in place.
"Big size and thick, as described"
"Material super soft, love it. Good quality and reasonable price too! "
Good quality and highly recommended!
Good quality and fast delivered. Around 10 days item received in a good condition and packaging. will give 5 stars to this seller. 
the purple colour is really pretty & comes with a mesh bag so i can bring it out with me for classes  thank you seller! 
this mat is light weigh so does not stay flat on the floor - can slip when doing exercise as the mat may move. please buy mat which is a bit heavy and stays flat on the floor
Product received in generally good condition. Very thick and comfortable to work out on. A good buy indeed!  
Good quality product! 
"Happy with the mat, not too thin, the pink colour is nice! No smell. Comes with the elastic bands and the netted bag too. Received in a little more than a week!"
Prompt delivery and item came in good condition. 
Received items in good condition. Nice Color n thick which comfortable for knee. Just a little bit of slippery if hands too sweaty 
Delivery quite slow. Happy with the purchase. Worth the money as its quite thick
"Just received the item , item sent from China .havent tried yet "
quality not bad 
Delivery is acceptable. Good quality as the mat is very thick. However i feel that it’s a bit slippery when there’s sweat on the map. Overall I’m happy with purchase. Thanks seller! 
Order came as shown in pictures. Quality still okay given the price paid. Good to have the bag and straps!
Big enough and non slip if not too sweat.  Not bad
"Strong pvc smell, quality is so so only. "
Well received today. Love the pink color. Thickness is not as thick as what i thought but i think its okay. Delivery took quite long i think. 
"Item is as described, very happy with the item and price thanks "
Thick enough to protexct my knees! The color is exact same with the picture and the packaging was nice. Thank you
Product received..bought together with a friend  hope it's good 
Received the item after 8 days. The quality is ok for beginner. 
First time buying a non slip mat and didn't expect to be so soft and at the same time non slip! Good buy 
Item arrived..Wife love it..! Thank you.. will comeback for more..!
It’s good but delicate.
Not as thick as i expected. But i m happy with the purchase. Prompt delivery. Value for money.
Product as described. Like that it is thicker and wider but it also come with the challenge of rolling it back to fit back into the back :) Otherwise all is good. 
Super good quality super soft super fast delivery but a little slippery when u first start using but after awhile it will stay in place very satisfied 
"Ok, feels very rubbery and I think likely To tear soon... hope it lasts. Poor cutting at the side :( but does not affect functionality "
Product came with a bag. Tried using it and It’s quite soft. 
"came in a good net, was very squishy and big enough for two people to share! Comfy to use. "
Good and cheap 
The quality of mat is good and soft but i would say that the mat is abit slippery and produce a squeaky sound 
Delivery was fast and quality is good as its thick and wide and it provides more space for me to do cardio and yoga..  
"colour true to picture! bag added as well, plus fast delivery!!"
"Quality quite gd... but thinner than expected, overall still acceptable just that waited 2 weeks for this.. "
This time the agreed quantity n size came exactly as ordered. Extra rubber lure given. I can pass on to a fren. Unfortunately due no stock all my 10g jigs had to be replaced with 15g ones. I hope 10g jigs can be restocked soon.
Took 8days to reach. Quantity is correct but seller sent wrong colour and sizes.
Thanks seller for the fast shipping and quality for this order is not shinny as last order. 
"Receive it in good condition, very like it. hope can bring me a good luck. will try it at next few days."
"Received in good condition, quality is good, worth buying,  Can buy again "
Great item.. will buy more..
Ok thanks 
Bad experience for me. Ordered quite abit but delivered 2jigs less. Also mixed up my colors n choice of jigweight pretty bad. I was informed only 3jigs color out of stock but ended up much more than that. Partial refund submitted plenty inconvenience there.
Tq seller
very good quality.
Great service have been using this jig for some time now never disappointed. Thanks for the free gift

Item received ...................... n  . ...............
Received in good condition and everything works as per stated. Good value
Good deal but not happy that your courier marked as delivered a few days before actual delivery. 
Fast delivery but with a few cracks here and there 
Not bad for its price. Deliver within 2 days. Will recommend 
Delivered within 1 week. Item true to picture in shop. Weight wise also true to indication.
" Fast delivery, looks good.  Thanks to the delivery lady who delivered on a rainy day."
order arrived within a week well packaged. just bear in mind the dumbbells are the sticky kind but it does it’s job :) am satisfied for the price paid! 
Material is good. Certainly feels like the stated weight. Super fast delivery. 
GOOD WEIGHTS! NO DEFECTS!
Surface is sticky but it actually helps me grip better.   Would have rated it 5 stars till I noticed the cracks and tears in the vinyl. 
"Nice, product just as shown on picture :) "
"I rarely give a rating below 5 stars. Yes even though this dumbbell is cheaper than others on shopee, but it was spoilt when it came. (picture shows it) Seller is super unresponsive. All i can say is buy at your own risk!"
"Super fast delivery and honestly other than this small print error it's all good, great price for the quality. "
Received with good condition! It's the cheapest so far.. And quality not so bad too.. Recommended! 
"Super fast delivery, received the items after 2 days of order and purchase!! The dumbbells have a nice grip! The only thing is that the 3kg dumbbell has a slight dent inwards and the text is kind of fading. Other than that, would recommend! "
"It's my third purchase from seller. Happy with all my purchases, quality assured!"
"Received 5kg dumbbells in good order, delivery was quite fast, and well packaged "
"This is my third purchase from your store! Super fast delivery. Very glad with the purchase, once again! :)"
fast delivery and product true to picture. cant wait to use it though it smells abit plastic but
Good buy!!!! Received in good condition - TIME TO GET MY FITNESS GAME GOING HAHA 
Delivery took about a week. Ordered blue but got red but it’s okay. Came with a few dents. 
That was fast. Thanks!
Quality good
"Ordered on the 24th of June, received on the 27th of June. No visible scratches unlike what I read from the reviews. Cheapest dumbell I could find, and them selling only one is another plus "
Received in good condition..price is cheap during sales..
Well received like the red colour very striking  But don’t like the sticky feel . Seems like will peel off easily 
Fast delivery and great product. Cheap and useful
Asked for red but blue arrived. Not an issue. But there's a slight dent in the 2nd pic. Would be perfect if no flaw.
Good quality and excellent value 
Delivery was prompt. Read reviews about ‘defects’ and one of the dumb bells received had a ‘tear’. Not a major issue for me.
"it is the sticky kind of weights which is not the one i thought it was, but it works well and came fast! "
Prompt delivery. Good quality for the price. 
Excellent!!!! Fast delivery. 
Goooooooood product ....fassssssst delivery .......highly recommend u buy frm Him....but no response n reply when u ask Him a questions. .......    
"delivery very fast received the day after i ordered, one of the dumbbell got dent but doesn't matter as the function still the same haha"
"I ordered for blue dumbbells but was delivered red instead.  Will still accept the products....but their service levels are really bad.  Despite several queries, replies were always the same standard response.  Not impressed with the company.  "
"Ordered on sat received on Tue, so fast!"
Good quality! Received in few days! 
received in good condition
Slight dent & scratches but overall quite satisfied with product

Fast delivery and item look good. Thanks seller.
Bought for my friend and he loved it! What a good price for these dumbbells!! 
"First time purchasing from this shop, received order within a few days! Item had a bit of scratches cos of the rubber.. but over all quality is still good "
Good quality. Best price. True to picture. Fast delivery 
Value for money.. Recommend to wash it with soap before use as there is a strong vinyl smell and is sticky when receive 
All good received thanks
Yes it reached! Condition is good. Recommend to buy. 
Fast delivery. Good quality dumbbells. Will buy again next time
"Got it within 3 days, really fast delivery! Dumbbell was a bit sticky but overall it still serves its' purpose and I don't mind for this price!"
Didn’t expect it to be so huge!!! But nonetheless looking forward to using this Delivery time was appropriate!

Quick delivery! 
Second purchase. Satisfied customer.
Very sturdy. 
Good. Recommended 
Nice and fast delivery 
This is really worth it to buy during flash sale. Too bad can only purchase one. Hope seller can consider selling a pair next time. Quality is not bad.
not bad 
"Received in good condition, thank you!"
"I ordered red, it comes blue. The chosen colour is red.  I checked with vendor since 18 Jun, not a single reply at all.  Very deeply disappointed and upset with the vendor, this small be my last purchase with the vendor!  Poor customer service. "
Scratches on the dumbbells. It dosen affect the function so it dosen matter but if you are really picky buyer do watch out. Not just me alot of buyers are also facing the same problem with this seller who seems to be selling defect dumbbells
Small imperfections here and there but can’t ask for more at this price. Now I can also workout at home 
Good condition.
Received in perfect condition. No complains 
Some dents on the dumbbell and owner reply very slow 
Thank you seller
"Good buy, should allow to buy at least 1 pair and not limited to 1 pcs only"
Very fast delivery and received in good order! However as mentioned by few other reviewers there are cracks on thr vinyl coating. Not an issue for me. 
Ok not bad 
Ordered the 2nd time coz the first order wrong size too heavy... delivery this time very fast
"Item received in good condition, bubble wrapped as if bubble wrap is free haha. Used the 2kg dumbbell and it’s good. Thanks seller. "
Thanks!!! Package and the dumbbell received in good condition. Thank you Ninja delivery. Thanks to you seller too.
Value for money ! 
"Second time purchasing from the seller. As usual, the delivery was super fast and the product is value for money!"
The outer packaging is ok but when received you can see that there are stains and cracks on the products themselves. The dumbbells are also pretty sticky. And the seller never responded when I first inquired about the shipping date. Bad experience.
fast delivery. wording abit smudge but i guess it's ok so long as it doesnt affect anth. worth to buy during flash deal. 
Items received and fast delivery. Weights came in a cardboard box and wrapped in thin plastic. Some cracks on the weights but I am ok with it. The dumbbells are quite sticky. I won't ask for much as it is the cheapest price I can find.
Second purchase. Got on 18/6 and delivered on 22/6. That’s really fast! 
Order came in pretty  fast. Loving the dumbbells ^^ yay !!!!! 
package received nicely ! received within 2 weeks from purchase
"very fast delivery upon request, quality is good, received in good condition. however ordered red but they came in blue."
"Ordered on 11/6 delivered on 18/6, that’s really fast considering it was overseas delivery. The weights were the cheapest I could find online. They’re comfortable to grip and are true to advertisement. "
Fast  
Good quality and very useful product! Delivery was quick considering the situation. 
"Item comes intact. Delivery took more than 2weeks. No bubble wrap, comes with cardboard. "
Seller totally doesn't respond to all queries and as mentioned with other buyers there's damaged on the item thou doesn't affect the performance 
Ordered red but send blue
Item received within a week of ordering.I would have given 5 stars instead of 4 if seller give me the correct colour.I oredered red but was given blue.other than that no issue.
ordered red but received blue instead. contacted seller but no response. vinyl is slightly sticky which is normal
"Second time purchase from this seller, however lots of cuts noted on the vinyl /outer layer of the dumbbells, which didn't happen with my first set.  Ordered 3 weeks ago, but only shipped out 3 days ago! Delivery man was very helpful and courteous despite having to carry a 10kg weight parcel."
Great product. Just as advertised. Been using it for my exercise and its just perfect. Will order again
very long delivery. think seller forgot to ship till i pm seller
"Ordered the red one but received in blue, but it doesn't matter as the quality is there! "
"Ordered on 24/6, delivered on 30/6! Very prompt service"
Received cracked dumbbell
"Even though it’s bubble wrapped , the dumbbell came with two dented parts near the edges. Considering it’s pretty cheap and still work as it should be , a little bit of flaw is fine. "
Thanks seller 
"Received it promptly! Provides good grip, and it's rubbery. But some parts of it ""melted"" a bit - like the 3kg wording became blur. "
"delivery was efficient! came in less than a week.  sadly there's a painting fault, (1st photo)  then there's some damages and scratches around, (2nd photo)  item was not wrap in bubble wrapper but just some card board wrapped around with scotch tape. "
"Ok for the price, came quite slowly coz of cb and had a few scratches. I also received wrong colours but it’s not a big deal. Still think they’re ok for the price. But it really smells of chemicals so wipe it down with Dettol or something "
Really cheap compared to other sellers! Item came promptly after ordering. Just need to air it because there is a smell
Bought for a friend so I can’t comment but good quality and fast delivery!
Item received so fast!! And good condition 
"Fast delivery. Ordered on Wed, received in Thu. Item in good condition. "
Super good price! The silicon is a bit sticky though.... but so worth the price
Really nice and the delivery was surprisingly fast compared to some feedback. The packaging needs to improve 
Minus 1 star because of the rubber coating having cracks...
Okay delivery time. Item has abit of damage but doesnt matter to me. Has a strong smell though. 
Received the heavy parcel fast and safely! :)
delivery took quite long but it’s okay. wrapped nicely and good condition
Stains on the dumbells but overall quality is good. Feels a bit sticky on the touch but I Guess it’s because of the material.
Gd deal. packaging abit off inside. cost my weight at wording '5KG' to be damage abit
arrived earlier than expected. well packaged and everything is good:) 
Ordered on 6/6 received on 18/6. Product looks great. Happy
Really solid and has a good grip because of the rubber covering.
Order red dumbbells but received blue?? Haizzz 
Ordered on Saturday night and received on Monday in good condition. 
Take long time to deliver 
Sides are a little damaged and overall a little sticky for the 5kg weights. The 2kg weights had no issues. Other than that pretty satisfied. Props to the female Ninja who had to carry 14kg to my unit 
Item came wrapped nicely. Shipping took awhile. Don’t know why since by ninja van. 
"Delivery speed was still okay due to covid situation, some dents found around the dumbbell and material feels grippy/sticky."
Came well packaged and in good condition:) also very fast delivery from time it was dispatched 
Item received one week later! Quite fast!! Have a smell and slight scratches but it is fine as it doesn’t affect me.
"Items looks good at first glance, but there are cuts found on one of the dumbbells"
Second purchase from seller. Resin didn’t set properly for this set but doesn’t bother me too much.
Material abit sticky.
Looks of good quality. Hope the rubbery surface won't melt and turn sticky over time. 
Good buy. Fast delivery and good quality
"Received in 3 days.  There’s some superficial scratches on both dumbbell, but its not a issue for me since the price is really low as compared to other sellers"
Awesome product! It was well packaged and delivery was smooth. The product came as expected and happy with purchase! Thank you seller
Well packaging and protect very nice. Color is nice too. 
took awhile to be delivered but is understandable due to current situation. Pricing are reasonable and affordable. Have a strong rubber smell when opening the packaging.
Delivery was fast. Vinyl material is good for easy wiping and sanitising because it’s waterproof. Happy with this purchase! 
product came as shown. true to picture and the numbers were not smudged at all. took awhile because of covid probably
Has some minor scratches and slightly sticky but is otherwise good! 
Well received 
Received in good condition. Thank you very much.
Material is abit sticky but overall a good product that does the job. Nicely packed.
Box was damage but item was not ..thanks seller ..
Received in 14 days. Item is bubble wrapped and in good condition. 
"it took arnd 2-3 weeks to arrive. agree with some of the comments, sticky feel (compared to the pink one I bought from other shop no sticky). but I dont  really mind"
As per advertised 
"Dumbbells received within 8 days, quick delivery :) second time I bought from seller, will buy again!!"
Nice!!! Thanks! Received in less than a week.
"Got what i wanted, price is reasonable except with few noticeable bumps, overall good enough."
Ordered a red dumbbell but received a blue one. Disappointing. 
received in good condition! delivery is fast as well. took roughly 1 week. 
"Ordered on 24/5 , received today 11/6. No reply from seller beside auto message so it was not a pleasant waiting time. Products arrived as described, some cracks at each end of 5kg dumbbell and a bit on 1kg. Guess because no bubble wraps on them. Might be damaged during shipping. Still ok to use."
Minor defect with pungent smell. Overall still ok
Items recieved pretty fast. Properly packed and items is sealed and new.
"item came well packaged, as seen in the picture  "
"Good quality, item looks as mentioned in the ad"
Very Nice and looks durable.

Fast and smooth delivery. Item received in perfect condition. Thanks a lot!
"No damages but there’s a really strong rubber smell, Hope it goes away after awhile"
"Item well received, does have some scratches and feels a little sticky and has a smell but overall its fine for usage. Thanks! "
The product came in good and well sealed packaging. Looks to be good quality. Have not tried it out yet but will do so soon! 
All good for the price. Came with a smell though. Rinsed it and hopefully smell will go away.
reaally fast delivery! also came in good condition! Theres a kind of smell but i think it goes away after airing it
came really fast. received them wrapped in bubble wrap but they have a few scratches.
Quick delivery - took about 4/5 days to arrive. Small scratches/stains on the product but overall it looks fine. Good grip. 
Items received within 10 days. Quality acceptable for the price I pay. 
Superb fast delivery. Purchased late night and received next day noon. 
Received a blue one instead of the red colour as per order. Quality is pretty good. 
Order came within a week after I made payment. Great quality! Thank you :)
"Poor service ... item stained as shown, seller should reply to messages thanks "
"Chip off product, looks used. Seller also do not reply, deal with caution "
Super fast delivery!! Bought on 6.6. Arrived in really good condition too.
Second order now! Delivery abit slow this time but item received in good condition :) 
Exactly like pic and in good condition. But do note that delivery takes quite awhile.
Fast delivery. Worth the price
Took 4 days to arrived. Pretty impressed given some reviews said theirs took a month. Item was received in good condition! 
"Good condition, received within 2-3 weeks as stated"
"Shipping came in 3 days, very fast delivery. It was well packaged ."
VERY MISLEADING. PEOPLE RECEIVED A PAIR OF DUMBBELL WHILE I RECEIVE ONLY ONE. Seller was unresponsive. Not gonna deal again. 
Item received as described...love it
"Excellent purchase. I normally dont bother with pictures or reviews. But this is rly exceptional. Good price, fast shipping - received item within a week (4 days to be exact) after ordering it. What more to ask for? "
"Fast delivery and good condition, I just don't like the smell but I understand coz is new.... Anyway thank you so much seller! "
"Fast delivery! Products are good too, a little sticky with a plastic-y smell though."
How in the world this pair arrive within 3 days.. Thats super fast. 
Very slow shipping both on seller and ninja van side. Also the item is quite beaten up with lots of scratches and small dents 
I have been using these dumbbell for a few times! Loving them and okay for the pricing 
Cheaper and good condition. 
"delivery was very prompt , product quality is good i like it . thanks"
arrived quickly despite the whole covid19 situation. dumbbells has scratches and logo was smudged. 
a little bit slippery but other than that all good! def worth the price. highly recommend it!!
"Fast delivery.   Item received as per shown in picture.   Thought it’s a pair though, but it’s perfectly fine. It is just 1 piece.   Thank you for the fast delivery"
"Ordered blue colour but received red. Also, there are dents in both the dumbbells. Both picture showing are 2 different dumbbells. "
"Good product, will buy again."
Arrived in good condition.
Good service
Came in good working condition! And delivery is very fast!!
Some of the dumbells were a ittle scratched. Really good for home workout!
Great product at decent prices! Would recommend buying this. 
"Bought this 5kg dumbbells and took more than one mth to receive it. Seller will never respond to your replies. Although is cheap, it came with an unpleasant smell. U get what u pay ."
"Although it has a strong rubber smell, item overall is still alright"
I bought for my friend to practice during CB. Quality is good. I hope that she will like them. 
Item came as described. Nice.
"Dumbbells received in good order, although delivery took some time but i am very satisfied with the quality and weights. Will recommend this, thank you very much seller!!!"
Good buy cheap thumbs up good for toning arms
Picture show a set but received one only. Quite misleading. When asking seller enquiries seller did not reply at all.
"I ordered Red, but come as Blue? But it’s ok.  As long as it’s 1 kg dumbbell. And can be used to exercise from home. Thanks."
"Dumbells came on time, good quality and ahah underestimated my strength by getting 3kg, it’s heavier than it looks. Worth it for the price and will recommend. "
"Suppose to pre order and already knew I had to wait 1 month for delivery. Even after extended shopee guarantee, item was not delivered. Sent 3 msg to seller, totally no response at all. When I was already waiting for refund, seller then send out item. Worst shopping experience ever"
Product chipped off! The other one had stains on it too! Not a pleasant experience
Poor quality!!! Meant to be a gift now I cannot even give it! Waste of money
Ordered blue but was delivered a red pair.  it would have been nice if seller inform me before hand about the colour change. Overall still acceptable. 
Fast delivery. Superb quality. Support local. Highly recommended 
"Delivery took abt a week. Love the dumbells, should have purchase 2kg instead."
"Good product, well packed "
Highly recommended. Good product  
Received well. Abit dirty at the ends but overall ok
"Delivery was quite fast, shiny rubbery coated material, not sticky. quality worth the price!! Thanks !"
"crack on the dumbbell.   Contact the seller, there’s no response at all.  Disappointed. "
"Delivery was within a week. Good value, item in goos condition."
item received in good terms but delivery took very long time! but it is ok as im willing to wait! hope to deal again. 
Took a bit Long to arrive but I didn’t mind the wait. It’s the cheapest I found. Recommended if you’re not rushing to receive it that soon. 
Well received within a week. Fast delivery. 
Delivery took very long; received in about a month. I’ve asked about delivery a few times but seller only gave automatic replies. The markings on the dumbbells were also smudged but it didn’t affect the function. I could still use them for my workout. 
Dumbbells are good quality but both arrived in red  when I ordered one blue for 2kg  and another red for 3 kg .  So I am not too sure if the order was given because there were no more blue? Or was it by mistake?
"Received with defects as shown, still can use and overall is OK, hope it can last long"
Item well recieved. Good material. 
Takes some time but within 2 weeks. Very heavy! 6kg in total. This is the cheapest vendor. Can buy!
The delivery was fast but still there is a bit torn here n there...
Expected date of arrival was in June but it arrived earlier. Quality of item is good and it's true to picture
The delivery was fast but the condition is a bit torn...
Shipping take abt a wk. Quality is not perfect. Some chips n lump. Price is reasonable. Look like same from decathlon 
Good product 
"Came earlier than expected. Well wrapped and in Good condition, great buy!"
Receiving the item one week earlier. Just leave the item to air for a while to minimize the odour of the Vinyl material. Thanks seller 
Fast delivery. Thank you.
The package was quite dirty upon received. Ordered on 30 apr and received on 20 may. Long delivery process. 2nd purchase and this time round received cracks/dented on both sides. Seller should hve checked the condition before sending.
I ordered a pair of blue and a pair of red but all came in red. Other than that all is good!
Some scratches and a bit sticky. Otherwise ok.
Waited very long . As u can see on the picture there is a dent on the corner. 
Well packed. Product is great. Delivery took awhile due to covid and holiday. Overall good. 
Received within 7 working days. Items in good condition. For the price you pay for is worth it. 
New and clean. Good to use. Thanks
"Great product quality, shipping is fast, very worth the money. Thank you, seller! :)"
Is sticky so I let it dry and see how it goes.  After 2 days still sticky and found cracks on the it.  Quality not good.  
pretty good quality dumbbell + good price as well. Highly recommend  
Great quality items. Delivery was prompt. 
it takess awhile for the shipment to arrrive. item was well packed
"Good buy, it is economical and did not take up too much space  "
Product came in good condition. Down point delivery is too long .if you dont mind there is difference in Weight indicated .
Defective items with scratches and tear. Bad attitude and terrible service of the seller. I wanted to cancel due to long waiting time but seller told me they were coming in 2 days so I withdrew the request. Ended up waiting for almost a month after that with seller ghosting me totally. Not worth.
You get what you pay for. Cheapest on Shopee and cheapest I’ve seen anywhere actually. Worth.
"item received fast and in good condition, will definitely buy again! "
Received in good condition. Loves the colour and I believe it'll really help in my workout 
Bought red 5kg weights. Sturdy handle and very happy with the purchase.
"fast delivery! 5 days and received :)) however, there was a cut on one of the dumbbells which was quite deep so had to patch that up. "
Quality feels good and it came well packaged! Can’t wait to use it for exercising
Good quality! Thank you!
2nd purchase. Good seller.
Nicethanks
Items arrived generally in good condition. Some scruffs here and there. The 3kg color has one that’s a diff blue from the rest.
Received items in good condition. Good quality.. value for money.. thank u.. 
"As advertised, delivery is fast."
"2nd time purchasing this, delivery came faster than the previous time, good to use "
"Items were exactly as described. But service could have been better. It took almost 1 month for the items to arrive and when I enquired, there was no response. I tried to cancel, got rejected and then I could finally see things moving along. I understand that its CB but please do communicate. "
Took awhile to come but the weights were good! Not sticky unlike its appearance. A little smell but not unbearable 
"Very nice blush pink. Im Adidas sports bra S, Nike M, cotton on S. Delivery took some time.   Edited after trying on:  Fits ok. Had sewing breaking sound when worn cause stretched. Not very stretchy in this case. Thick material, can feel hot easily. Nice cutting to hide armpit fats. "
Well received. Love the colour and material. Easy to wear it but difficult to remove  
"Ordered 18/06, shipped 19/06, received 24/06. Fits decent except strap is a little loose for me tho it does not slip while I’m moving about. The band is not stretchy; heard thread snapping when I tried pink one.  For purple, 4th pic = true colour. Colour runs while washing!  Stats: 171cm 46-48kg 28B"
"Got it in M size previously and it was too tight but now L fits me well! Am a uk8 for reference. Moving peach items are def worth the purchase, i got this during flash deal which is really worth!"
Second time purchasing this design. My favourite design from moving peach thus far. Comfortable but not very stretchable so might be difficult to remove/wear
"Quite a good buy, no discoloration after washing. But not as stretchy as other sports bra bought from reknowned brands. That's the only downside. "
"Second purchase of this bra. Super comfortable and flattering cutting. Im 163cm and 58kg. The straps are quite wide apart and are a little lose so they slide off when i do side planks. But i think M might have been too tight. But in general, really great bra for at home workouts!"
"Quite a long wait for the product to arrive. Quality is good, with thick padding and nice cutting. Saw many comments suggesting to size up; I still opt for the smallest anyway, and it’s still good! Prefer sports bra to be fitting as I will be using it more for running. "
Delivery took awhile....... item received in good condition.... however would prefer it to be more fitting as it is for exercising 
Tried it on and jog on the spot and is very secure just that a bit tight. Worried if I buy L will be loose. 
Good material and a repeat customer of moving peach... definitely worth the price
"Delivery speed is good! Received in good condition! My second and third purchase, the cutting is bigger than the other types. But the colour is pretty! "
Not bad quality but the colour in this pic is not representative of the actual colour. Will recommend. 
Comfortable to wear. True to size. padding is very comfortable. Color is nice too. 
"Looks like the picture, should be good for low to medium impact sports, but not breathable "
"Item received in good condition, delivery did not take too long. Love the support of each sports bra."
Purple is a very nice colour. Usually a 70B size M fits well..
"Fast delivery. Materials of normal quality. Pants are smaller than I expected. On the contrary, tops are bigger than expected. "
"Good quality, nice TOP, will recommend only for low intensity workouts "
"Sized up on from my usual S to an M after reading the reviews (I'm usually UK 8, 53kg, 34B) - it fits well. The colour & cut is as seen in the photos and it's flattering despite the built-in padding. Have yet to try it out during exercise so not sure how it will feel then."
"Good quality, will consider purchasing again. No need to buy one size up."
"Delivery took about a week. Quality is good for the price. Size is alright, usually wear uk 10. Love the color."
"It’s really good quality! Definitely will purchase this again. Just a piece of advice for those thinking of which size to choose I am usual size m , us8 for bottom and top usual size s, us6-8 just stick to your own size. As the pants is Super stretchy so don’t worry. "
Item received as per picture! Quality is soft and comfortable! 
"This is our 2nd time ordering. The quality is good and reasonable price. It's fitting is very comfortable, the colour is nice too."
"Colour is true to pic! I’m UK 6, 70B and purchased M - fits well and is secure enough at the straps, just hope with subsequent washings it will not become loose. Item feels supportive enough even without the removable padding. Will not hesitate to purchase more!"
"Got on flash. Quite worth it. Comfortable material. Thankfully I sized up. I'm a 70B usual uk6 for tops, or xs-s. But I got a M in this. "
Happy with purchase. This is my 2/3rd time buying. Great quality! 
ordered on 1/7 received on 9/7. very satisfied with the quality for the price paid just like the other reviews!!!! 
"Item as described, pleasant and fast transaction! Thank you "
"well received, quality is very good for both pieces, cant wait to wear them"
"Great quality for the price. Size up as recommended by most buyers so it’s feel comfortable. But if you intend to wear if for high intensity workouts, I would recommend to stick to the usual sizing so that it is gives more security"
"Second time buying, love the purple because it has a nice white lining inside"
"I’m a repeat customer and these fits me well. I’m a 34b/waist 26/uk8. I wear size L for moving peach sports bra. For shorts, I usually wear a M for moving peach but I read reviews recommending to size up and I’m Glad I got a L for this design as it fits me just right. "
This is my second colour and I’m loving this quality!!! So good. Wearing size M and my usual is size S. Fits perfect for me. 
Material feels nice and the cut is nice too. Delivery a little bit slow. 
"Colour is Reallt pretty, the material is thick and good! Damn worth!!!  "
I’m a usually uk 6-8 and I prefer the fit of S to M for high impact workout:) worked out in it once and I think it’s great for the price:) 
Super fast delivery! My 2nd buy from Moving Peach and it’s the exact product because it’s so good :)!
Delivery took about 2 weeks or so which isn’t too bad. The quality of the sports bra is surprisingly good for the price. Highly recommended!
Delivery took awhile. Item is of good quality with affordable pricing. Second time purchasing (: 
"received nicely packed in zip lock bag :) repurchased this and found this size to suit me the best. I'm selling Pink size L on carousell, @elelzl, pm me if keen! "
"Order on 01, shipped on 03, received on 09. Good quality, third purchase from seller :) "
Cutting smaller. Would recommend people to size up. 
Size m fits well for me! I usually wear a nike sporta bra size m as well. Great buy! 
"It looks big, but when worn, super comfy!! Great deal for the quality"
really love love the material!! and colour is true to the picture. slightly fitting am B70
Colour true to photo. Decided to size up after reading some reviews but L is a little loose on me (C34). Not much support when doing high intensity / jumping exercises. Sweat marks very visible fyi
"Material is Super comfortable, and it’s Super good!! Highly recommended "
Item well received. Need to size up for a more comfy fit. Recommended for this price. 
Good quality and support! However M size is slightly loose on the rib cage for me but just right for the upper portion. I am 44kg for reference and a uk 6 
Read reviews to size up and I'm glad I did. Fit is not bad but material is not very stretchy 
"item came exactly as described and colour exact to picture, the material is so comfortable too!"
Second purchase. Quality assured. Bought one sizing smaller for better support. 
I love the material and the size is so fitting and not tight at all. Worth to buy at promo prize. Material oso super comfy. 
"Really good! Looks v nice. Wore it for run, very firm and nice"
I love it! Cutting is nice and super comfortable! The quality is really good and colour is really nice as well. 
"Great crop top that can be worn as a top. Not necessarily suitable for HIIT, but good for yoga and low impact activities. "
"Good material, good quality.  maybe will try to buy other model (more to bra style instead). "
Looks and feels good. Worth the purchase. Item wrapped nicely 
Rlly love the fit and quality of this piece!! So worth the price
Great top and colour. Like it. Delivery was faster than expected. This was my second purchase! 
Items came nicely packed. Material very comfortable. Looks just like the photo. 
Not too bad- just slightly tight. Overall good buy.
Comfy and fits me well
"A bit thick but it fits perfectly! Cute color too, i got the purple one :) "
The coating sticky and got torn otherwise will give 5stars
Second purchase from this seller. Good quality product at a cheap price.
Looks good ... :)
Ordered on 1 June and came on 4 June. Super fast delivery. Quite good quality for its price. Although there are some stains/print defects but still good to use.
Waited almost a month to receive it. A little sticky and some bumps..but it serve the purpose! Might order more.
"Second time buying, recommend if you are looking for reasonable price sports bra"
"Quality is really one of the best I’ve ever come across! Smooth and comfortable! Just that there may be some sweat marks appearing... other than that, really highly recommend to get this!! "
Second time purchasing this but in a different colour! Really love the look and feel of this item as it can also be worn as a crop top. Worth it when its on discount!
"fits me well but elasticity wise i feel it's a little tough to remove, maybe its the cut/design or the material..."
Delivery time was shorter than expected. Sport bra material was of good quality and true to size. Worth the money! 
quality seems good. recommend to size up 
Took awhile but am pleased with items. I’m a uk10 bottom xl size fits well. 
Comfortable material 
"material is good, colour is good, but i wear my black one more often"
Good material. I like it!
Moving peach does not fail! Hope it is comfy as the others I bought! Thanks!
Delivery took really long but overall the quality of the product is not bad. 
"Item received as ordered. Quality is good, will order again. "
Very pretty! Nice material too. Worth every penny and wait. 
"Chose one size up, but i still feel its tight! Material is comfy though. "
Received in good condition! It doesn’t support very well but it’s pretty and worth it for the price (for lighter exercises that doesn’t require too much jumping). 
"Took a week to arrive. Smooth, buttery soft material. Both colours similar size. Fits nicely. I’m 1.6m, UK6 to 8 for tops, 75B. Consult seller if unsure of size! "
Fast delivery even tho is from overseas. Love the quality and the colour. 3rd purchase from this store! 
"My ptp is 15.5-16” , bust 33”. I think M is ok when worn. But the thing is wearing it and taking it off is a bit too tight.. but I’m not sure if L would be too loose. Good quality! "
"Took about 10 days to arrive, quite fast. Increase a size to M and it fits well. Material is very comfy"
"Great material and love the cut and overall look of it! S fits me well, I'm usually ptp 14.5"", bra circumference of 65cm."
"Items received in 11 days, of decent quality. Sized up as per comments. Am a 16.5"" PTP and L size fits fine. Not the most supportive but light exercise is fine. Worth it to get during flash sale!"
"Size M fits well, second purchase. "
"Received in good condition, material is smooth and slightly thick"
Items received in good conditions and this is my second purchase. Worth buying during flash sales. 
Delivery is fast & fits well! 
"Received within 2 weeks! Cute colour n comfortable, but when u wear it the white inner lining can be seen slightly. Thanks seller! :-)"
Very nice! Fast delivery. 
My second purchase of this comfortable sports bra! Love it love the price! 
Item true to photo. Have another colour and I love it! V soft too
do not size up for this!!!! will expand after washing and the support will be gone. thought it would be too small for me hais
Worth the price. Love the material! 
For reference I am size 4 for lululemon. Size M is abit loose for me I think I will size down next time. Material is nice and color true to pic.
"Second purchase from this seller, item received in good order"
good quality  fast shipping  will buy again  thank you seller 
"Very good material, comfy!"
Happy with the purchase. It's comfortable and the padding is quite thick compared to other sports bra. 
"sizing runs quite small. material is alright, but don’t think it’s suited for heavy/vigorous workouts. good enough for the price paid "
Well received and good quality! Do buy 1 size up from your original sizing. Good buy! 
Seller was very helpful in changing the size to S cause my first purchase arrived in time for me to try the size out. Bought during flash sales and the material & colour does not disappoint! It’s not super fitting like other sports bra but comfy enough to do light exercise. No regrets! 
Overall ok but there’s slight threads that came out...
Mid or low intensity workouts. Not recommended if you have big assets   
"The colour is nice. :) This is my second time ordering. (I ordered the first batch about two weeks ago). Their bras are pretty good. :) It is nicely snugged. Love this piece amongst my whole purchase. Would recommend this. However, haven't tried on an intense full-body workout. Quality is great too "
"Looks nice, have not tried on. "
"Not bad, comfy and a snug fit. I like the colour. A bit of a struggle to get out of cos it’s tight, but I guess that’s all sports bras haha"
"Good quality sports bra, with thick sponge which I like. Product is as shown in pic. Sized up and got M based on the comments and it fits me just right. I'm 163cm and 51kg (PTP 30-31""). Cant wait to use it for my workouts, and also looks like it can act as a crop top for going out too!"
Delivery took a while to arrive. Quality good but sizing a bit too loose. Overall okay not bad 
"like it so much I got another, this time size M fits me really well. thanks seller!! "
a good fit and quality material! it is also very comfortable
Size L was just nice for my chest area ( UK 8) but the waist was slightly loose. I’m a PTP 16.5 & waist 12.5 but however gives a very comfortable allowance and I can still can exercise while having ample support! Material is very comfortable!!! Highly rec(:
Delivery took more than 1 wk. Good quality. Received in good condition. 
"Tights are very good, quality much better than expected. Might restrict movement by justtttt a little bit. Sized up as per comments, usually a uk6 and I bought L. Sports bra for me a bit too loose. Usually a B75 and bought M, but will buy S if given a choice again. "
"I soooo love it! The quality of this brand is great. It’s cheap too and all fits perfectly. I’m usually size M and ordered size L as most recommendations suggest to size up, and I followed and all fits perfectly. Definitely recommended "
"A little tight, took some time taking it off. Will think about buying one size up on future purchase"
"Take note that not all moving peach items are self manufactured. Bought 5 items and only 2 was self manufactured with its own branding and packaging. Their self manufactured piece like this bra runs extremely small, am a uk6-uk8, 75B, but unable to fit size M at all. Quality is great though."
Nice colour. Great fitting. Quality looks alright. Hope it lasts Long. 
product and colour is exact to pic! i’m a b75 and M fits me fine but if you’re worried then it’s better to size up! 
Very very affordable and the grip is good. Can do more intense sports with this. Delivery was fast. Good buy. 
Super happy with purchase. Sports bra and shorts quality were both good and comfortable. Will purchase again!! 
Sized up for this. Fits well and love the material. Very comfortable.
Nice quality and nice design. 
items took awhile to be delivered but overall everything seems good.
Love the materials but size run small so took one size bigger.
Nice and soft material. Ok for less intensive workout. Received within a week.
Very nice! My third time purchasing their items 
Really impressed by the quality! I am a UK8 and size M fits very well. Would purchase again. 
"Ordered on the 3rd of June, received on the 12th of June. Vert satisfied with the top. "
colour is true to pic and size fits well too!
Really pretty but might have consider buying one size smaller for more vigorous activity like running. A normal workout seems okay! It feels just nice on me right now and can even wear out as crop top. The material is very nice too. I am 160/60kg with A-B cup. Bought it at 6/6 and arrive 16/6
"I bought Pink M size for this. The length is 32.5cm width 30cm , quality not bad is stretchable. when you wear it you can actually see a bit of the white stripe showing out on your shoulder which is pretty. Im 158-160cm 50 kg,if you have armpit fat I won’t recommend it to you as it will show."
Orders came in 5 days!! Very happy with products :) thank you! Will definitely purchase again
The colour was really solid. Comfortable to wear and soft!!
"Material is stretchy and soft. My size is UK8, I bought size M and its a tad loose on me. Probably will size down the next round. Not returning because it’s comfy! I can wear them for home workout :) "
"Item finally came after a while!! Second purchase, this time in a different colour cos its just so comfortable!"
"Item received in good condition. However Size M feels abit loose for me, I’m Uk8 for top, 32A."
Love the material and cutting! Was initially afraid that size S will be too small after reading other reviews but S was the perfect size! Estimated delivery was close to a month but items came after 2 weeks. Overall good buy especially during flash sales. 
"true to colour! am 34B / 80B, size L fits perfectly. padding isn’t too thick or uncomfortable so don’t think there’s a need to remove like some of their other bras! super comfortable."
Receive in approx 1 week. Received in good condition. I like the material and cutting. Bought it during sale. 
I owned a cotton on sportsbra size L. But sadly this is just a little bit smaller. Managed to squeeze in but can feel the tightness on me. Otherwise the material is great! 
love the design but L is big for me. selling on carousell @elelzl if you're looking for the one in pink!! 
Nice material. Like it so much  seller also kind enough to help changing the size last min. Will def buy again!
slightly bigger than expected seeing how ppl say to size up. i’m a 34B and thought L would be ok but the strap keeps falling. hoping it’ll shrink in the dryer haha. 
Am a 34/75 and size M is quite tight for me  nevertheless quality is good. Will repurchase in larger size
Items received in good order. Bought it during flash sale so super value for money. Material is really good. One thing about these sport bra is the support isn’t very good. I’ll rate 60% for the support. I’m 34D and L fit me nicely. 
this feels tighter than the other sports bra that i bought tho it’s both the same size. love the fitting tho! 
"Fits me perfectly. For reference I am 34B, 53kg and EU 34. Really like the quality of it. Will surely buy again in the future."
fits well im 51kg 160cm. it definitely has a pushup effect. its not super tight bc i kind of sized up seeing the reviews that said its not stretchy (really isnt). but its very comfortable
Extremely pleased with fit and quality of this! Didn’t take so Long to arrive as well. Got this in my usually size. Didn’t size up. Am ready to purchase more from this seller!
Very good quality and comfy material. The colours were really pretty too
very comfortable!! my 2nd time purchasing and i bought a lot of pieces 
Excellent delivery service!!!!! Excellent quality!!!!!
I’m a usual size S for all my sports wear and size M indeed fit me very well! Have yet to work out with it. Hopefully it would be great!
Love the design! I’m a usual moving peach size M and it fits well. I have slightly narrow shoulders so the straps got a little lose when doing workouts. 
"Nice material, feels comfortable. Very nice colour too. Thank you seller!"
"Delivery took awhile, but received all in good condition. Material is good, value for money, excited to wear them. Thank you! "
This isn’t just a sports bra but it can double up as a cropped too. Love the unique shade of purple as well!! 
Purchased during flash sale and I must say this is a pretty good buy! Stretchy and nicely coloured. Will buy again :)
"Nice colour and easy to wear on! Material is good, quite buttery. Sized up as advised which is good but would prefer it to be more snug. More suitable for yoga/low intensity workouts as the support is quite minimal. For reference, I’m about 70” below bust and generally UK8 for tops. "
"For reference, I am 160cm, 53kg. Size S was super tight and I had problems getting in and out of it. It will be better to size up. Material is not super stretchy, so there’s lesser allowance. Overall it is ok if I got the right size."
"Delivery was prompt and sports bra looks good, will purchase again  "
"Great quality for the price! I’m a UK 8, PTP 33-34” and L fits me nicely. If you like a tight fit, could get a size smaller! "
It’s quite nice! When I put it on there were some thread breaking sounds when it was stretched. Quality is not bad! However when I wear it can see the white inner stuffing
Very Good material compare to my previous purchase from the other store on Shopee. The size fit me perfectly. Will shop again. It will be better if can be faster delivery. 
Order well received. Have yet to try the sizes yet. Quality feels not bad. Hopefully it fits well on me. 
"Bought this during flash sale, worth it! Good quality too.. "
"Looks great, q comfy. Recommend to size up! For reference, I’m 163cm, 48kg, took a size M :) "
Love love love the TOP!!!! It’s so cute and comfy and it’s neither too small nor too big for me  will definitely buy from the shop although the delivery took a little longer. But who cares as Long as its here right? 
"Sizing feels abit small , do size up! "
Really like the colour and the size fits very well!! Feels of good quality and supports well even though its light support. Size is good for me at 34B chest size.
Pretty goodd v comfortable material and fits me pretty well
"i love it, it's super comfortable & it's my 2nd purchase  i will definitely purchase moreeeee"
Great material.  
"Ordered the black one, the material is great and very comfy. Would buy again!"
Item received in good condition .
"Good quality, however wish that the inner lining would be the same as the external one! Overall quite a good buy"
"Got size L. Fits well, not a whole lot of support, but very flattering on the bust. Padding is thick and gives a good lift!"
Ordered on 4th June and item delivered today 16th June. Checked and tried. The size just nice. 
"Not very sweat wicking, if you sweat a lot just take note of this."
Fits nicely for me that usually wear XS and S for branded sports bra. Definitely will try their pants and other products.
"I bought 4 Moving Peach bras and this one is my favourite. The material is so-so, but the inner lining is nice. The padding is nice and thick, and the support is okay. Quite comfortable for exercise! I am 75A and size S fits well. Would repurchase!"
received in good condition. i like this shade of purple a lot. thank you
The fabric is smooth and the sewing is ok. Worth the price pay for.
Love the pants !!quiet comfy n size just nice .im 160tall n 59kg! Second purchase 
Quality is solid 
Good quality. Not suitable for bigger bust. It would be good if there is XL. 
super pretty colour and good quality. ordered on 6/6 and received 17/6 via normal mail. straps a little loose for me. 
"ordered on 5th June, seller shipped out on 6th. received it from China on 13th June. The shade of pink irl is very pretty. Took my usual size S (uk6-8)"
"Probably my favorite items amongst the 10 I bought in one go, as a first timer to this shop. Lol. Came exactly as pictured. Feels soooo soft. Don’t need to size up or down. Not all products are moving peach just FYI. "
does not feel like gym/sports wear material. feels nothing like lululemon/nike/gym shark. NOT a substitute for quality gym wear.  great for home and sleep though. it's padded and comfortable so there's no need to wear a bra.  
"Good quality for the price. The fitting is okay not too tight not too lose. Not very stretchy so imo up one size than your usual size would be better. Overall, am pretty happy with the items i got. "
I got delivered my order before the 2 week mark! I'm quite pleased with it!! Overall a great product and price. 
"Am usually a Nike L, Cotton On M or a 36 bandsize and this fits true to size. If you have a large cup size, the thick padding might cause a push up effect. Would recommend this for low to medium impact activities. Material feels very nice and smooth. "
loved it - for the price very worth it. only wish the inside lining was not white but same colour as the top. I wear UK6/8 - M was great fitting. 
"Looks great! Can’t wait to wear it, material is super duper comfortable as well"
Good received.Quality is quite good .Will buy again.
"Love this! Third time purchasing from Moving Peach, shipping takes about 2-3 weeks depending on the items you order I guess. Still worth the wait :)"
Love the shade of pink! The material is really soft and comfortable! 
"Really love the sports bra and shorts from moving peach. This was my second purchase and i have already selected more sports bra for my third purchase. Quality is good and price is affordable as well. Love the colour selections, hope they will bring in even more designs in future. "
second buy. received in good condition. padding is thick will recommend. 
Received as advertised.
"Very satisfied with my buys!! I’m a repeated customer and have never encountered any issues. Read the reviews, sized up and it fits perfectly! "
"Item received in good condition. Repeated purchase, comfortable and affordable."
Fit me well.  The material is very comfortable. A great purchase!  As what the reviews which I read. Need to add in a size bigger and glad I did that. 
"My second buy of this design! Hopefully L can fit better than M for me, which was a little tight."
Fast delivery! The quality is good and thick.  Tried and quite comfortable. Like it! 
Good quality and really pretty piece!!! I’m a usual UK 6 and size S fits just nice especially if you are using it for HIIT workout :) recommend!! 
The bust area can be tighter bcos only the band area is tight. But it still good! 
Very comfortable. Highly recommended  
Good quality; thick material. Received within a week :)
Received in great condition. The sports bra fits well and colour is nice. 
"material feels good and bra is supportive when worn! fits well too! however, bra is not elastic/ stretchy enough so it’s a little difficult to put on/ take out. overall still a worth it buy esp for its price:-) "
"Very good material! I read the reviews before purchasing but was still surprised at how good the quality was given the affordable price! Very happy with my purchases! I took the advice from other reviews and got a size larger. Normally wear size S/UK 8, bought M and it fits really well! "
"surprisingly happy with the quality, its rlly thick and comfy. size s is just a littleeeeee bit big for someone who is a usual xs, but no biggie."
Material is not very stretchy so if would suggest to size up if unsure! 
"2nd time buying! Still loving it a lot, especially the colour and the material! "
"Package arrived quite fast. Within 1.5 weeks. Nice and comfy material, with nice bra support, though might not be suitable/comfortable for high impact exercises. Good enough for yoga and low impact exercises."
nice colour. sizing is snug. the arm straps kiap my arms a little tho
"Fits perfectly for me, I’m ASOS petite uk6. Made the right decision to stick to size s. Think cuz I’m quite flat chested lol "
All the items are wonderful! Worth buying! The seller is kind to help as well!  Thanks!
"I weight above 65 kg and I’m afraid that bra gonna  be too tight, it doesn’t at all and so comfortable and the leggings are my new fav already. I might order again. Good"
Very good! Satisfied with my order! Definitely will buy again. 
"Love the cut, the material is good for the price"
"This is my second purchase for sports bras from this shop (previously ordered different designs). Am pleased with this purchase as I was for the others. Size L fit me well. Bought during a flash sale, so it is worth it. Thanks for making quality sports wear!"
Material feels good! Have enough support for more vigorous exercises like HIIT. Overall good buy! 
Quality feels good!!! soft and comfortable. M size is just perfect and not too tight. I usually wear M size on my other sports bras. 
"Repeat purchase, love the cut! Usual uk6 for tops but sized up to M"
This design in white has a slight confusing measurement :/ the size is fine but the fit is just abit off (side bust area) but have to honestly it’s very obvious. Really like it though.. I will try to alter it to the best I can :(
Value for money. My third purchase from moving peach. 
"Cutting on the small size, not ideal for L size wearer as I’m a M-L."
Everything fits
I’m UK 8 and fits perfectly. Love the material too. Delivery took awhile but it’s understandable. 
Delivery took longer than expected due to Covid but Really good quality but needs up size! 
"it’s a little larger than i would like for sports, but nonetheless very comfortable :) "
Overall is ok. Color is nice and size is just nice. However this design might squeeze out your arm pit fats. Comfort wise is ok.
"Items received in good conditions. Like what others had reviewed, the materials are very comfortable. I was hesitating whether to size up (like what most had said) but I’m Glad I didn’t. It fits nicely for me. Will consider buying other colours (: "
Material is not too bad for the price. Currently a D cup and I can wear the L but it feels a little tight. 
best sports wear shop on shopee!! comfy and pretty apparels 
"Decided to size up to L, but wished i’ve gotten it in M instead for more support/higher intensity exercises. Also feels like it might stretch out after a few washes. Still a good buy and pretty color!"
Super comfortable! Really love the cutting of this but chest wise might be a bit low cut.... 
Delivery time was not too bad! Color is true to pictures and the quality is good. Padding is a little thicker than usual. 
Lost count how many items i ordered from moving peach 
"Leggings is good, need to size up. Sports bra sizing is sooo small - need to size up. "
"Delivery was really fast (I was expecting a 10+ day waiting period based on reviews); ordered on 28/05 and it arrived today!   I’m 150cm, 42kg and size M is too loose for me, esp the straps part :-( "
delivery took about 2 weeks and received in good condition! didn’t size up and stuck to my original size and it fit well; wanted it to be slightly tighter for support and size S did just that for me. quality is good too and colours true to pic. purple is gorggggg thanks seller
"Satisfied with my purchase, got this during flash deal and honestly paying only $12 for this quality is  Sizing wise, I sized up like what most people suggested and am glad that I sized up. Even though it doesn't feel that tight but I prefer to have some space so it's not that suffocating."
Really comfortable material. But it’s more for low impact sports. 
Received in good condition not sure when worn how does it feel but material seems comfortable and cooling kind will purchase again ! 
34C-26-36. Bought L for both. It doesn’t look small but material doesn’t really support HIIT exercises. Maybe yoga ok. Tights thighs area a bit lose too but no restriction in movement. Wouldn’t buy sports bra again. Maybe tights only ba. Cheap deal though! 
Really quick delivery despite this CB period and the quality is there with the price paid for. 
fast delivery! quality not bad but won't recommend for sports because its a bit thick 
Items arrived in 1.5 weeks. Quality is very good and material is thick yet comfy. Size runs a little small but still could fit. Will definitely buy again!
"Delivery took a while, but looking forward to try these pretty pieces. Thanks!"
Order received within 11 days! This is considered fast shipping during this period. I normally wear size S but ordered M for this. I recommend you guys to size up for a better comfort. Thanks Seller! 
"received in good condition, and it’s exactly as described. seller was very friendly and patient too !! "
"Love the color of the sports bra, color is true to pictures provided. Would recommend uk6/8 for tops to stick to size S if you want to wear it for higher impact exercises. Size M also fits but it’s not as tight as I prefer it to be when jumping."
"Fantastic! Quality is quite good for the price. However, delivery took quite long. Nonetheless, will purchase again!"
I’m usually a size M for sports bras but I decided to size up for comfort and also due to other reviews. Fits perfectly :)
Surprised with the good fit and material. comfortable to wear but maybe not for high intensity sports. Fits B75 well but only gripe is that i wish the inner lining was the same colour as the outer one
"Good material!! however, it came with a different brand on its tag but still good quality overall and would recommend! easy to take off also because of the design"
Received in about 10 days. It’s definitely “low impact” in terms of support! But very comfortable and fits well! 
"For this price, i would say that the material is pretty decent. Delivery was relatively fast. "
"Items well received! XL leggings fit comfortably but the ends at the ankles were loose, looks more boot-cuttish. The M sports bra is real tight for me though, would have been better to size up as a whole! The other L sports bra that I bought fit nicely. For ref I’m 1.68m, 53kg, 75B/C."
Return buyer cos I absolutely love the material! Delivery was slightly more than a week.
Received in good condition. Thanks seller!
"It fits well and material is soft, might get a smaller size next time as it's quite loose. Delivery was on time despite the constraint now and package was nicely packed"
Has got to be my best purchase from moving peach till date. Will definitely buy it in order colours soon. 
received with a stain at the back that didnt go away even after washing 
Contray to what others posted. I didnt like this piece as i felt it cuts into my arms and restricts my arm movement. Still giving 5stars due to customer svc. Delivery is long...
"Items took really Long, about 3 weeks probably due to the different collation from various sellers overseas but items all came correct and the packaging came in different types overall quality is quite okay, except for the legging which is slightly see through when stretched. 4 items for about $50"
not 5 stars as i dont love the straps + support isnt great. but comfortable to wear as a crop top or yoga 
just arrived - earlier than expected. have yet try it but looks good. 
"Fits quite well, usually a size S for Nike sports bra as a gauge. "
Padding is thicker than expected but worth the purchase!! 
"Delivery took abt 2weeks, came in good condition. 2nd purchase. Shorts are comfy."
"Comfy and nice. I usually wear M but I bought 2XL and it fits nicely. For the price, it’s actually worth it!"
Material is a bit rough but works well as shorts for the home or running errands. 
"Not the best material (the grey is a bit translucent), but comfortable enough for home wear. "
"received in 11 days in perfect condition! it’s very comfy and fits nicely on me (waist-hips-bum: 76-92-100cm) however, do note that it’s a bit translucent in sunlight and the shorts keep folding upwards (3rd pic) which is annoying ...could be better at this price ..thank you seller! "
2nd time purchasing the shorts. Came within 2 weeks and looks good.
"Yay happy with purchase! Good quality with reasonable padding, support is not bad. Colour is slightly darker in real life. Do note that the white inner lining will show a bit & to be careful as its abit difficult when wearing and taking it off. "
"Very happy with the quality for the price paid! Came earlier than expected too! Will definitely buy again! Sizing wise, I sized up as what most people recommended. But the band for purple crop can be tighter. Not complain Ly coz it doesn’t look loose. Just doesn’t feel tight enough :)"
"Delivery took super long this time round, took 3 and a half weeks. Love this design, it is very flattering. Bought this in S first but it felt too tight even though the size given was right, so I had to repurchase it in M. For reference, my under bust is 71cm. Recommend to size up."
Good quality and cutting. I am a usual size M and it fits me well!
"Padding is a bit thick so is Great for people who wants to enhance shape. Material is thick, fits well and very comfortable. Have bought multiple yoga sports bra from them. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. "
I am 34B and the L fits perfectly. It’s not too tight and loose. Sits comfortably. Fabric buttery soft. I am a convert. Highly recommend 
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   Material: thick & structured + comes with thick bra padding (removable) Cut: Flattering, feminine & also trendy enough to be worn out as crop tops Sizing: Runs small, do size up. I'm usually a UK6-8 & M fits perfectly"
Not very elastic so when I tried to wear it can hear some sound. Can't expect much for a $9 sports bra. Overall still not so bad. Took about 1 week+ to deliver. 
"Received in good condition. Fast delivery, took almost one week to come. "
"I am a B70 but find S a little loose. Granted the bra is difficult to remove, it is not tight enough for sufficient support. Material is alright. Padding is thick. Delivery is relatively quick."
Received as advertised. Good material
"Got a sports bra and leggings, would recommend leggings more as it is very comfy and smooth. The sports bra is of a different brand than moving peach, and the material is not as buttery as the leggings. Took quite a while to get the stuff, ordered on 05/05 and only came on 27/05."
buying for 2nd time cause wife said is comfy. thanks fir fast delivery despite the covid period.
Delivered in good condition.
Absolutely loved it!!
Fast delivery! 
it's not cotton but still really comfy! 
very goodthank you seller
"Shipping was fast, came within a week! The quality is good as well, feels like dry fit"
Followed the reviews and ordered one size up. Good decision! Suitable for wearing at home or working out.
2nd time buying. I like the shorts. Very comfortable. Value for money. 
Fast delivery. Good quality and item received as per photos 
comfortable and fast delivery! 
Delivery was fast. Quality of shorts is good. Thank you.
I bought a pair of white shorts and Camel coloured belt and they came fast enough! The shorts has a waterproof feel just like fbt shorts so great for exercising and the belt colour looks really good irl and is versatile to match with shorts and even simple dresses!! Worth the price
Usually an S but L fits just right. So definitely recommending 2 size up
I ordered 2 sizes up. So maybe a little big but comfy. So 1 size up should be just right :)
I only received 1. Yet to try but the quality seems okay.
Good material would buy again 
"Fast delivery, good value for money. Quite comfortable and okay material"
item very soft and nice 
Product received in good condition.
It’s okayy it’s wearable but a bit hot!!!!There will be a slight V shape
"second purchase, fast delivery with good quality product, like it so much . "
I think the shorts is okay and wearable. However the cutting is abit weird such that it makes you look shorter and bigger than usual. Thus not as flattering. It is no doubt comfortable and good for home wear. 
quality is alright 
Item just like pic Seller sent me the wrong colour  It shall be grey but i received black col N i bought 2XL for The usual M size that i wear n imo it’s just nice the size..
"product was exactly the same as picture, material is also not bad and package was well packed"
Material ok...size should be ok... For my wife to wear... Lol
Received. But wrong colour. Order grey but received black. 
"Delivery was fast, but sizing doesn't seem right. Size 2XL fits more like size M."
for wife. material is good. good buy. thank you fo sending over
Nice material and good quality to sleep in....hope to see more colours and more sales......
Material is light . . The thigh hole is a larger than I expected...

"Correct size delivered. Note that there is no inner lining. For home wear, acceptable. Probably need to be conscious about color of what you wear underneath this shorts."
Fast delivery despite covid 19. Comfortable for home use will buy again
"Fast delivery! Received in good condition, really soft and comfy too. "
Received with thanks. Good quality and style. Also fast delivery.
Very comfortable to wear and material not so bad. Recommended to buy!
Need to buy 2 sizes bigger. Overall is good. Material is probably polyster
Great quality for the price. Recommended.  
Size is just nice. Feels quite cooling for the weather. Came within 2 weeks
Received well. Material is good and sizes are nice for my girl.
I like their shorts
Second-time purchase. Delivery faster than ezbuy. 100% recommend.
"Fast delivery in a week. Material not very comfy, a little prickly. But size is really very very small considering that it's already 2XL (already 2 sizes bigger). Need to lose weight first "
"Shorts was nice, fitted just nice. Material is comfortable, will buy again."
"Material is okay, not too thick/too thin. but the tigh portion abit too much cloth. made it looks very big when worn"
"Product is good. Nice design, shipping time reasonable. Thank you "
Product received in good order within 10 days. Nice material. Very comfortable! 
"it looks pretty small, thought i couldn’t fit but ends up it fits me just well :)"
Really glad that I bought 1 size up ! There's quite abit of space at the thigh area
"the clothing for both shorts are different, if aim for sport choose the black one, if casual wear recommend the grey one, which is slightly thicker "
"Decent quality and 2XL fits snugly on a UK 12, size up if you prefer a slightly looser fit."
Gd material. Fast delivery 
"Material was ok. Delivery took awhile. For the price, no complain. Thanks"
White is transparent. 
Delivery quite reasonable considering it's during CB period. First time buying to try after seeing good reviews. Hopefully the size fits as I have yet to try out.
Good buy. Perfect to be worn at home; thin material but cooling. Also bought one size bigger and fits just right.
"Very comfortable! Good buy! But pls check order, cos i got 1 missing piece. "
comfortable & nice! colour is just like shown in picture tq!
"Purchase 2 time, the pants is really comfortable and worth the price. Recommend!"
"For the price I got it at, I think it’s worth it. Washed it and everything is still in shape. "
Fast delivery received within a week of purchase good material!
rly comfortable! the string is yellow-ish but wear at home ok la haha
"Well packed in resealable bag. A few loose threads but no issue. Different material for both colours, grey is cotton while black is like FBT material. "
Quite a good fit. A little small so be sure to buy a size larger. 
"The delivery took so long, about 10 days. But anyway, Im very satisfied with the short. I never tried but it seems like  it fits me. Luckily I took XL, usually my size is M-L. "
"Haven’t wear but feel the quality not bad, thin material, bought the correct size, I am usually M size but I choose L, so I suggest to choose one size up! "
"The quality is not very good, but the size is just right, it is still good to wear sports, thank you"
Shorts received in good condition and fits well!
material quite comfy :)
"Well received, material does not look from what I expected, but nonetheless it is definitely ok for the price paid. delivery time is alright for overseas shipment. "
"Item as described, get L if want more comfort... not hot when wearing "
Item received in good condition. Size seems ok. Waistline rubber not as tight as I thought. Hope is comfi.
"Received in good condition, fast delivery, material feel comfortable. "
"Happy with purchase! I’m 165cm, 48kg, EUR 36 and L fits just nice. For a looser pair to wear at home, can consider XL. The grey and black material seems to feel different. Grey feels more comfortable to me."
received in good condition. not yet worn to try
Great service from seller   order on 30april 2020 received my order on 11May 2020  Thank you so much seller 
Received in good condition. Delivery is also quite fast too.
Shorts came within a week and quality is not bad for the price! Will buy again :) 
Fast delivery. Well packed. Size must buy 2 size bigger.  Cutting quite small. Lucky fit me as I get 2 size bigger.
received both in good condition! personally prefer the grey one as it’s more cotton material! but both are very stretchy! love it for the price!
Comfy
"Received in good condition, satisfied with item & it's price."
Item well received. Material overall is good. Thanks seller.
"order received but foot too wide, doesn’t look good :-( quality is acceptable for price"
Different materials received. Grey one is good. Black not so much
"Size is smaller than expected. Buyers should size up. But good buy, comfortable. "
"Came in great condition as usual. Will continue to repurchase. Since it's for home wear, will recommend to size up for greater comfort"
The shipping was quite fast. The material is good . So far I’m satisfied.
It's way to small for a XL. Suggest that you order two sizes up instead. Material is a little rough on skin .
"Second purchase, decent quality. Good value"
Item was delivered promptly and came in good condition! Worth for the price.
Good purchase! The size is just right and quality is good. I will definitely consider buying again! :) 
Good quality shorts. The white and black one are smooth textured whereas the grey one is cotton like. Love it. 
"very comfortable!!! im 55kg, L is great "
Exact to pic and delivery was fast material of pants was good as well
A bit small Normally i wear M but i buy two for L size  If getting XL will be comfortable to wear
"For the price, ok to purchase. "
So happy to received the shorts..  Just fit nicely.. M size is OK for me.. 
Love these shorts! Ordered twice alr!! The black is very slimming and I have large thighs so the sizing is very accurate! Recommend 2XL for bigger girls like me! Very comfortable and not too short and revealing! 
Ordered on 2 may and received on 12 may. Received in good condition. 
Material reminds me of a thicker fbt-like fabric. Fit is not too bad. Just wanted a pair of shorts for home use so no complains here. 
"Love the cutting of this sports bra! I’m a UK4, and S fits perfectly for me. "
This was really comfortable but so tight! I had a lot of trouble getting it off. Keep in mind I sized up a lot - I'm usually either an XS or S and I got an M. Its perfect to wear but a pain to take off. 
Neckline is lower for me. Preferred the tank top yoga top (in green). M is a perfect fit. I'm 48kg.
"I’m 1.64m, 75B and usually size M. This is a L which fit well because the band isn’t that stretchy. Material is thick so I’ll probably wear for activities where I’ll perspire less. "
"Love it the cutting! Do size up, size S was too tight for me previously (I'm uk 6) and had to re order this. Material is thick and soft too."
Cool design. Nice colour. Quick shipment. Will buy again. Recommended.
"Fast delivery, good material"
I am a size S but I bought xl aft seeing the reviews . Abit big but comfortable and I feel tat is right size if u want comfort :
Need to increase one size bigger .
Rough material Personally I Don't like it at all. But it's reasonable for the price. I am uk10 and 2XL is fine 
"Size and length is not too short, just that the material is slightly abit thicker. Will suit to wear during cold/rainy weather"
The quality of the shorts are quite good. 
"This is My second purchase, like it very much.. "
Love it
Very nice to wear .
"I thought it was cotton material, is polyester. Overall is good. "
"Shorts is a little shorter than FBT M size, no inner lining for your reference, but love the material :) Worth the price! "
Second time purchasing from seller and bought three more shoets.. rly worth
Item received in good condition will consider to buy again
Reasonable for the price 
It is quite comfortable as I prefer these kind of loosen type...
"Fast delivery, the size is right. Cutting and fabric materials is fine. Worth buying "
Order 3 pcs in black and grey. Delivery took 2 weeks to arrive. XL look big and hope it can fit me wearing at home.
"Item received as shown on pic, good quality and delivery were fast too! "
Item is good. Comfortable shorts. Will order again.
Okay for the price paid. The material feels like made up of high percentage of nylon. Was hoping for it to be cotton but this is okay for the price paid. 
Materials is not bad but the cutting abit small. So do buy 1-2 sizes bigger. Delivery is from overseas thus abit of a wait. 
"Look not bad  Different colour,  Different quality  Black , Grey n White  All different type of fabric  Disappointed on this :(:(:( "
"Upsized like the reviews suggested but ended up too loose... I bought 2xl. My waist is 70cm,161cm tall, 55kg"
Fast delivery and good product! Thank you for your services!
Quality is not bad for the price!!! It’s really cute and comfy for home wear!! Note that there’s no inner lining!! :) 
ordered two of these.. arrived faster than i thought. good quality and very comfortable. 
2nd purchase! Delivery quite fast.  My 3 girls love it. Thanks for the free gifts! 
like it. shorts is quite good quality in my opinion. good for home wear or for exercise.
"material is a little thicker than dri-fit, overall pretty worth for price paid though i doubt I'll buy another pair"
The material looks good .not for fussy buyer. Looks big for XL size
Received on time and good quality 
Material is fine... Good buy
"Good, lightweighted, easy for jogging"
Good condition 
Item received in good condition! Delivery faster than expectation. 
Very comfortable and nice 
Materials still consider ok.for this kind of price. 
Haven't tried yet! Hope it is comfortable.
Ok
"A little bit smaller than expected, and the material is a little bit like Lycra, but overall not bad. "
Received in good condition! Thank you
Oops small don’t think I can wear it
"Delivery was pretty quick, quality not bad for the price. Definitely a good buy! "

Delivery quite fast!  Good material for the price. Will buy again.  
Second purchase.... 
Worth buy for the price paid. Delivery time was not bad still acceptable but not the fastest. Overall happy with the purchase. 
"quality ok for a cheap price like that, impossible to find outside :)"
"Fast delivery, different material. Both is okay depend on individual likes."
 nice thanks seller
Very goo materials. I bought grey and black will buyore again
good quality very comfy
Received in good condition!
"comfortable but i got the size too big, the waist is stretchy so i would get one size smaller "
good materials. worth for the price. exaxtly shown as pic.
"Comfortable to wear, but material is a bit thin, maybe not suitable to wear out. Comfy enough for home wear!"
The material is thin but quite comfortable. 
Second purchase. I like the material which is not cotton. More comfy
"Nice! The reviews are true, grey and black material different. Nevertheless, it's comfortable  My bottom is uk8 and fit L just nice!"
Very soft and cooling material. Wish there were more colors for the shorts. 
 thank you !! Recommend!!
Overall not too bad quality. Bought four piece at once:)
Quality is okay for the price 
"Cheap, good quality, fast delivery! Recommend!"
Love it~~ worth buy for the price ~~ early delivery ~~ 
Just got the goods today will let my wife try it out later.  
Personally prefer the quality of the gray shorts as compared to the black shorts. Overally sizing is comfortable and length of shorts is good. Might buy again.
Item recorded in good condition and delivery was fast. Would recommend 
Item is good 
Loving the shorts! Delivery took awhile but all worthwhile at this price. Very happy with the cotton material.
Size runs small. Material is non cotton. 
Comfortable 
Comfy wear. Good quality 
Thank you
Thought it was cotton material but it’s chiffon smooth smooth material. Still happy with my purchase !
"I ordered 2 pcs of M size and 2 pcs of XL, then end up received  XL are exactly some size as M .VERY disappointed !"
Affordable price.. quality worth it.. short & s3xy.. hehe!
"So happy i bought this amazing pants at just $1.77! bought only 1 cause scared size not suitable. Turns out M size fits me well, pretty sure M will fit many too, i am 154cm . Material is good. So sad now price increase, hope drop again and will definitely buy diff colour."
Good quality at an affordable price. Recommended!
Items arrived within expected time. The quality is quite good and hopefully the color will not run while washing.
Received within 5 working days. Good condition. Thanks seller.
"Item came as shown in the photos. Bought 2 black and 2 grey as home shorts! Rmb to size up! I’m size M for bottoms but I bought size L, fits just nice. The black is more of a polyester material but the grey is slightly more of a cotton-ish material with polyester feels. Definitely will buy again!"
Nice quality pants. Daughter and me love to max. 
received the pants in good condition. bought size L &XL both can wear n comfort
Size not true to chart. Its comfy . But tight. Suggest 1sizeup
Receive in good condition! Thks seller!
Good quality and fast shipping!!!!! Will order again 
Material of the shorts are weird and it makes you feel very hot. But looks exactly like the picture! 
Good quality and worth it for the price 
"Wait for one week plus . Today received it . Look nice , worth it  ."
"not bad, good price will buy again."
Well received but yet to try.
Bought one size bigger. Fit just nice. Material is ok. 
Good and thick material. Will consider to buy again!
Cannot complain about material for the price! Very worth it. Now price increase but still cheap. I bought at $1.77
Order on 22/4 and receive today. Material wise okay for the price. Overall happy
Received well. Thanks seller.
Good product quality. Cheap for the price too. Thank u seller 
Came in good condition! Agree with the other comments that you should size up. Material is more similar to a dry fit material!
As advertised. Quality is good. Take around 2 weeks to received due to current situation 
Love the shorts! Going to reorder more colours  Thanks seller 
Quality is good. Worth the price. Might order another pair. 
Very comfortable and size is correct. Will order again as it's so affordable! 
the size is just nice Need to take 1 size up
I like the quality. It’s comfy
"Fast delivery, worth to buy! "
Received within a week. Thanks! 
well received! Accurate to the picture show! Thank you!!!!
"the shorts came within a week which was really fast. overall quality is not that bad ig , material is quite dry but what can you expect from a $2 product. "
"This is my 2nd buy and buy extra pieces for my housemate too. I like the grey material, is more like cotton ish. The black color also quite okay, but is not water absorbent kind of material. The white material is same like the black color, and can be quite see through if you wear a dark undies. "
"Material wise is hot cause is not cotton. It feels like Ike some cheap fabric with plasticish feel. I usually wear XL so xXL was just nice , have enough space left"
"My waist is 71cm (28inch) and hip 97cm(38inch). I got myself 2XL (black) and it fits comfortably! I only bought it at about $3/piece, and the quality is good! Highly recommended!"
Well received on good condition. Not the material I want but it really value for price. Size XL more suitable on below wrist 29inch (depend). 
Very nice 
Ordered wrong size .
comfortable 
Black one material is different from grey one. Overall good for this price
love it!! get xl if your waist is ard 24-26 L would be fine or 2xl as i got all 3 sizes it wouldn’t be like too small for L or too big for 2xl 
"material not the best but still acceptable, delivery kinda fast tho, thankyou! "
The shorts arrived in about two weeks.  This is my second order.  The other commenter was right - the grey shorts are more cottony
"Acceptable, quality not bad for the price  Fast delivery too!"
Material looks good and size fit me as I order bigger size then usual I wear. 
"Come exactly same as the picture shown  Smooth material but the material is translucent,  can see through underneath  Otherwise is all fine "
Material is poor synthetic. Not cotton at all
"material is soft but a little scratchy, should be fine after washing fits M/L with a little loosely  "
Good quality. Would recommend as it's really cheap 
"ordered 2 black and 2 white but got 2 black and 2 grey instead... material of black shorts - slightly like swimming shorts  material of grey shorts - cotton  overall is okay, acceptable for the price paid"
Super happy with my buy!!!!! V nice comfy material too!! Great as sleep shorts. :) 
Good product quality. Size xl like s haha
very thin
"Material too thin, can see through even when the color is black. Not cotton. Value for money, but will not buy again."
"Really happy with the size. I'm a petite size, 153cm and 49kg. L is nice as it's comfy and isn't too tight or lose. If you want something tight fitting, you may wanna try a smaller size. Will get more from them!"
Its good
"Honestly not at all bad for the price! The size looked quite small, but it fits well. I think the fabric used for black is more of a jersey-like material than the gray one."
I am usually size M. I weigh 61kg and 165cm tall. The pants fit me just nice. Would have gotten one size bigger for home comfort though! Thankyou
"Take some time for SingPost to deliver , shorts received as advertised."
"Very affordable and good quality!! Surprise can fit me,my thigh circumference about 62cm"
The material varies not all cotton.. prefer it to be cotton
OVERALL SATISFIED  SIZE IS CORRECT TOO  RECOMMEND TO BUY A BIGGER SIZE  CUZ IM S/M  LUCKY I BOUGHT L
"Pants was alright, a little too long and cutting abit weird but pretty fine for use"
Item received exactly as shown by seller and very quick delivery considering the situation now
"2nd time purchase in this store but this time, bought a different item and during flash sale. Super like this! The material is not see through. I love the fit. Can even use it and pair it with jeans. Will try a different colour next time. "
Second purchase from seller. Decent and affordable active wear
"Straps non adjustable, would need to alter it a little to make it slightly tighter for a perfect fit. Material is not translucent at all, very comfortable and soft. I'm a B32 weighing 48kg, and size S fits perfectly."
top material feels really soft and comfortable. good for low intensity workouts or even for wearing out.
"Delivery took roughly a week and it’s my second time purchasing from them. Material is thick enough, dual layered. Love them as much as my first purchase. Thank you "
quality is pretty good even though it is not a legit brand!!!
"Repeated buyer here. Padded, very comfy. Got extra elastic band for comfort and support too as seen in video rating."
I received this item in good condition . Love the color . not much support but Very comfortable to wear .
"Item received in good condition, have not tried yet but quality feels good "
Received in good condition. 2nd purchase and I love the material as usual.
"Fast delivery. Materials of normal quality. Pants are smaller than I expected. On the contrary, tops are bigger than expected."
love the quality and the fit. is not too lose around bust area. would recommend to buy. 
Very good quality and satisfied with purchase. Will purchase again
Quality of the shorts is not too bad but I really likes it very comfortable 
Delivered in 6 days. Items as advertised and quality looks good. Good buy!
"Very nice quality, will surely  buy again.."
"Colour of the strings was weird and yellowish, but other than that, it’s okay "
Quality is acceptable and delivery is quite fast. Price is cheap will buy one more. 
quality is very good & very comfortablelove itwill buy again
the sizing is perfect but i dont like the cloth of the shorts. 
"Good quality and cheap for ppl like me not willing to spend so much on clothes, clothes are lame but you still have to wear em, "
items received in conditions.
nice tq
"material is quite thick and stretchy. for the price you pay, it’s really quite worth it. would have bought a size smaller for a better fit. am UK6 "
yay received the sports top and it’s really comfortable !! :-)
All clothings fits very well and are comfortable! Will purchase again :)
Good value as always! Top doesn’t fit me that well (am AU 2 or XXS)
"Item received in good condition, rlly love moving peach product, very good quality and very nice colour"
My photo is a little dark - it’s a maroon colour. I’m usually size S but bought M because i didn’t want it to be too tight or too short 
"Similar to picture, fast delivery and highly recommend!!!!"
Item received however material abit hot 
Material is thick. 
Good quality. Perfect for home wear. Fast delivery too. Thank you.
Good stuff. Good price.
Item nicely wrapped and delivery is fast. Reasonable price for its material. Abit too for me as I’m a S but M seems to be the smallest option. 
"OK but abit short for me , abit translucent, overall  OK to wear "
"Quite a nice pant and the delivery also very fast, like it. Will order again. "
good 
"Buy many times from the shop. Fast delivery, damn worth for the price."
Received in good condition. Delivery is fast considering it's shipped from overseas (received within one week). Bought 2 sizes bigger and it fits comfortably. Strings are yellow and look  a bit weird but can't complain because the item is cheap.
Received item in good condition. Ordered 1 size up. Waist was just nice but opening for thigh was too big. Material was ok. A pity no pockets
Cheap n worth buying as quality is okay. 
Value for money!
Good quality shorts !! Will definitely buy again !! Thanks for the fast delivery!!
Item received as what was advertised and nicely packed. size fits. happy with the purchase.
It look good and quality not bad. 
"Fits me well. Good quality, thick and comfortable. Recommended "
"Unpleasant smell. Material is thin and somewhat suitable for swimming type? But not exactly swimming costume material. Very see through. Good thing is that the pants is longer at the back than the front, minimise risk of exposing the butt. "
The material might be abit hot to wear. But still worth the price.
product is true to picture and super comfortable to wear when working out! great quality and absorbs sweat. will definitely purchase again!
"i love the material! white is not translucent at all :))) im 165cm, 57kg and size M fits me very well!!! "
My thurd purchase. The materials are superb 
Lovely neutral piece that matches with any work out bottoms. Amazing quality Can't wait to try! 
"163cm, 48kg, size M is a little loose for me. But very pretty! "
Prompt and hassle free delivery. Quite pleased with material and colour.
quality is decent and delivery didnt take too long!!!!!!!!!
Material seem good. Decent for the price paid but i have yet to try it to see how it fits
"This is my second purchase compression pants fits me well I got the xl size im 160tall 60kg.quality is very nice will purchase other colour.tops is bit tight but still can manage,my size is 80B ..highly recommend !!thanks seller"
Ordered on the 5th and received on the 14th. Very comfortable!
Material is good but the size like quite small. 
"Love this, the cutting is amazing!!! "
Fits well and material is good!
Usually an S for sports bras. This fits fine but could be more secure. Might not be suitable for anything more vigorous than yoga/pilates. 
Not really fitting. Too loose and does not suit me. Can’t hold my chest in place
"Ok piece, as strap cannot be adjusted, it’s a little loose at the top for me as bust is not big enough."
"Not bad! Material is stretchy, there is padding, straps are not so thin"
"Usual size M, 165cm/52kg. This top is a little loose for me at the bust. Other than that, quality is amazing! "
"very comfortable and nice material, has a band inside for more support. the pads are quite thick and removable!"
"Ordered on 13 May, and finally came today on 24 June. Super long wait, due to the covid situation. I love this piece "
"Nice fitting, good quality.. happy with this purchase.. this is the largest size (L).. their tops seems to be on a smaller size but still can fit with your own size, only if you want it more loose then opt for bigger size. Im 63 kg and 80cm under bust size."
Received in good condition!! Material is very soft and comfy to wear but th padding a bit too thick 
4th order !!! Good and affordable material
Second time buying from moving peach. This time not 100% satisfied with all items. Not very fond of colour and fit is fine but not very stretchy material. Don’t quite like padding too. The neckline area also has fabric that kinda “pours” out. Would be better suited for ladies with bigger busts...
Item received after almost 6 weeks.. long wait.  But overall satisfied with the product and quality.  Might consider to purchase again if shipping is not so slow.. 
Bought size M previously and trying out size L this time. L is not so tight fitting and much looser. Prefect for loungewear! Will be getting other colours too! 
delivered in 10 days! Received in good condition! Will recommend 
I ordered black but change to navy blue and the seller did change for me  It’s really comfy and pretty! 
Delivered in 8 days. Items as advertised and quality looks good.
Delivery was okay. Material feels good. Yet to try it out. Thanks 
 Thank you. Pretty top. 
"Good material and thick. But strap not adjustable. A bit tight at underbust (bust 70, wt 50kg). But if i were to buy L, it will be too low. Meant to wear as inner wear as some tops hv low cut. Overall gd buy. "
not a fan of this!! it keeps rolling up! some weird stitches!! delivery is fast! 
"Bought Size M before, trying out L. Feel that it is is actually bigger than M by a fair bit. In general consider comfortable. "
"Material is quite elastic, however I feel that it has become slightly loose after washing"
Received earlier than expected. Repeated purchase. Good quality and comfy!
Love it 
Rlly good quality. Usually an S but read reviews and sized up. Fits perfectly. Love the in built bra. 
"Material is thick and stretchy. Great quality for the price! Size M fits UK 8-10 well. The pink colour is more of a coral-peach shade, very pretty!! "
Good products!
"Super satisfied with every single one of my buys!!! Fits well, good material and affordable:)"
"Love the colour, but not a huge fan of the material, it’s not the smooth and cooling type. The inner elastic band is also a bit scratchy. Support is average, probably more suited to low impact exercises. Padding is nice and thick. I am 75A and size S fits fine. Not impressive but ok for the price. "
"The sports bra is really quite small even though I bought large. It is not suitable for ladies with big chests. I’m at 75C and it’s really too small for me, which is a pity as the material is really good, and worth the money. The top is also very comfortable."
Coverage is definitely not there. Nice piece to wear out but not sure if it will hold up. 
"I am in love with the light grey sports bra top and the navy blue sports bra! Both are comfortable to wear and color is nice too! The grey sports bra top comes with padding, so it’s easier to wear and covers arms part XD will buy again if needed! :) "
Received it in a good condition Material is good and comfortable. I love the colours.
"Comfortable to wear, support not that much, but love the color and material"
"Very good quality product and fast delivery. Comfortable wearing it, happy!"
"great for workouts at home, I am 58kg 160cm and M size fits me nicely."
"Really comfortable and stretchy material, but not much support. Would recommend for lounging or yoga but not high intensity sports! "
"Items received in good condition, very pleased with quality. Will definitely buy again.  Thank you seller.  Recommended!  "
Happy with colour and material
Took measurements before buying but still feel slightly tight with M size under bust area. Intend to use it for home workout  
"Got the white piece, and item fits well. Got a size 6, was just nice for a uk6. However it’s slightly big at the chest area for me, so not recommended for high impact or high intensity workouts. Material is comfy, though the most sweat resistant. "
"Good, fits well will repurchase when needed"
does not feel like gym/sports wear material. feels nothing like lululemon/nike/gym shark. NOT a substitute for quality gym wear.  but great for home and sleep though. it's padded and comfortable so there's no need to wear a bra.  
"Second purchase. Love the pastel mint colour. As usual, not much support (straps a bit loose), good for those doing simple exercise. Not meant for running/HIIT."
"First time buying to try. Delivery took awhile, probably due to CB. Material felt okay, just hope it fits as I have yet to try."
"Received in good condition and very fast. I am a size M but I got a size up, but would have preferred M size for a better fit. "
"The item is great! Well- received! Love the quality and it’s true to its picture. Likewise, the sizing is fitting."
Nice and comfortable. Love that it can be worn as a short spaghetti top for outing. However cutting of this top seems to be bigger than the usual moving peach sports bra. I should have ordered a size smaller.
2nd time buying love the material of the TOP  will definitely buy more 
"Item received in good condition, but did not really fit me well "
It fits nicer but I would prefer it to be a lil’ looser! Just ordered a bigger size from seller and awaiting for my next package to arrive ! Super comfy to wear it as lounge wear too 
"Body-hugging and very thick quality! Feels almost like swimsuit material. I am 160cm and 47kg, and S is quite tight but still breathable. I would recommend it if you would like to buy a cheap workout top!"
Received the items after more than a week. Smaller than usual size. But I'm really satisified with their products! With reasonable price also. Thank you seller. Will definitely buy more
"item is as pictured by seller, do note it is fairly low cut and exposing (this photo is a good gauge of how low it is). 75C, can fit in size M just right. padding is abit too thick for C cup. at first it fit weird around armpit, then i realised the padding was inserted upside down. after adjust ok "
"ordered on 1June, seller shipped out on 3June, received it on 9June. took my usual sizing "
Fav top for workout!!! Padded so no need for sports bra..... 
Good !
Received in gd condition. 
Comfy! Abit loose at the straps for me. Will try a smaller size next time 
Good quality. I like.
"Good material at such a low price. Should have gotten an S instead of M. Might purchase again in the future. Delivery was fast, the parcel came in about 1+ weeks. "
Third buy with them!! Super love their products and quality! And it’s cheap too! (: 
good material and feels tight enough! very worth for the price actually  haven’t tried doing workout in it yet but would purchase more 
"Second purchase and super in love with everything! Super good quality, super good material and super comfy! Especially the tights, fits damn nicely! Definitely will buy more!! "
"I'm 170cm, 55kg. I previously bought a size M and it was super duper low cut, the armpit holes were also huge. Decided to get a size S to try and the holes were still super big but this time it was tighter. No difference among sizes for the holes, mainly the bra band and length of shirt. I prefer M!"
"Nice colour and comfy material, worth the price!!"
"Material is thick, do not worry it will see through which is safe to put it on, comfortable as well."
Very good quality very similar to the ones from cotton-on body 
"Looks goodgood material, although the color fades every time I wash it & the straps are loosening "
"Good quality for price, thick cup, low cut"
Delivery was quite fast. Quality is good but it would be better if length was abit longer .. 
"I like the material, but the cutting was a little weird for me. The size fits perfectly on me and i'm a B cup. This is more fitting for low impact workouts!"
"Fast Delivery, received within a week. "
"Just wish the straps are shorter or adjustable, but other than that the material is buttery soft and comfy! Does not have any lines from the bra pads, leaving it super seamless!!"
Great deal!!! Love the quality and worth the money. Decent delivery time during COVID. Will buy again
Would prefer a tighter fitting so would prefer a size down
"I love the fitting, color and the fabric! I will definitely will buy again."
"It is super soft and comfy. But the cut in front and behind is slightly lower than expected. If you’re planning to wear this for gym workouts, it might be a little revealing. However, it can pull off as a comfortable inner wear with jackets or any other outer wear! Highly recommend. "
sizing is slightly loose around the waist for me and so is the neckline but the inner lining fits fine. 
Delivery was unexpectedly fast and the item that came is true to the pictures that was posted. Material is also thick and comfortable. Will be making more purchases as price is reasonable as well.  
Good material Cutting a bit off But overall is great Will purchase 
A bit low cut in my opinion but i do enjoy the comft of this piece. Have repurchased it in another colour. Delivery takes long though....
Quality is really good! Have yet to try it on. 
Comfy and breathable especially in humid weather. Love the material! 
"Very comfortable to wear! Size is alright for me I'm 153 cm and 48kg , fits well thank you!"
Not the best but you get what you pay. 
Good quality product from this shop  comfortable sports wear
Cutting a little big. S is too big for petite frame (usual ptp 14.5-15”)
Delivery in good condition.. as always good quality from the seller 
"might want to size up can be a little tight. bust support is not excellent, okay for light exercise. padding and elastic band is separate from fabric (see pic). color difference is rather large - very diff from color shown in listing. material is rather comfortable!"
feels comfortable but it is totally not supportive for bigger busts (D cup) the straps r also very thin (doesn’t give support)
Item received in good order within 8 days. Good quality top but not suitable for high intensity workouts. Would wear it as a normal top instead. 
Quality is good for the bra. I took my usual size and it fits well. The delivery took quite Long though. 
This top fits great. It doesnt provide much support but it is comfortable for loungewear at home or yoga/ low impact activities
Love love love this piece! Fits me like a glove and its super soft + comfortable to wear! Will buy again & really recommend!!
"Thicker and better quality than expected. Am a UK size 8-10 and this top was a very snug fit, which I would say would be a good size for exercise. But if you want it flattering then maybe size up. Bra pads for this seems thicker than usual so I Guess that’s what they mean by push up. "
Nice colour and the material felt good. Bought 2 sizes to try. I'm a uk8 for top. S is fitting. M is slightly loose tho felt more comfortable.
Rather good quality for its price! The padding is quite thick and even the white piece is not translucent at all too. 
"Top is very comfortable, in built padding is also thick enough for coverage. Straps are not adjustable but it fits me perfectly. I’m a 167cm, and the length of the top hits me nicely at the waist"
Nice colour and nice material. Super comfortable Like it so much
Good quality! Padding is too big but that’s wont be a issues as you can remove them. Will purchased again :) 
Pants have a nice colour. The top material is quite thick though... 
"delivery took almost 20 days to arrive i like the colour a lot but my only issue is the sizing  i bought both M and L but both is so freaking tight lol, it was a struggle to put it on. im a size 32d,definitely not suitable for more curvier girls. hope that they will bring in bigger sizes  "
Delivery took awhile but overall seems good quality. Thanks 
Comfortable to wear. 3rd purchase. And ordered other stuff tat is otw 
"Quite good quality!! I wear between XS-S so this fits me just nice, but just a tiny bit loose "
Extremely happy with the product. not thin and very comfortable
First time trying them out. Material is really comfortable. Will buy more in future!
"Quality of material is really great, though it's a little on the tighter side. Delivery also took close to 4 weeks, so take note in case you want it fast."
Excellent service by seller who packed the item nicely. Good quality product. Happy with the purchase. Thanks. 
"I'm 170cm, 55kg. I would say I'm pretty broad but size M was too loose for me. The string was too long so the entire top was very low cut"
"Is a little tight. I recommend size up, unless you like it tight.  For reference: I wear UK8-10, 70C "
Comfortable to wear. But waiting time was a bit long. Still happy with the purchase. 
Cutting is very small. Material is also thinner than the previous ones which I’ve bought. Gotta size up. 
Material is thick. Feels a little warm. But fits a S size person well. 
"Top fits like a glove, fits true to size. Padding is very thick and removable. Only downside is delivery takes some time, but overall worth the wait!"
"Padding is abit too thick but material seems strong, I like the dark grey color"
True to colour! Comfortable. Would consider buying another peice. 
"material is super comfy, thanks seller! "
Material is comfortable and true to the picture as advertised. The bra top comes with removable bra pads 
Delivery took 17 days  Quite comfortable. Wondering if sizing up might be better 
"Really love the cutting of the bra! Not super tight and doesn’t hug the body that well, so not recommended for high intensity workouts, more so on low intensity but also note it can be quite revealing!! I’m a EU36, and I ordered size S, fits well!"
Take quite some time in delivery. Good quality material with the price paid. Like the design. Will order again. 
sport bra very comfortable. Happy
2nd purchase and highly recommend! Really love their shorts and bras. The camisole style tops fit really well too! Delivery taking longer is entirely okay as well given there’s no rush for me in receiving the items. Thank you!!
"Always live their products and delivery. However for this series, it is not recommended for high intensity activities as the support is not there. "
i receive the parcel nicely and i love it.. thank u seller
4th purchase and definitely coming back for more. Received in good condition and faster delivery time. 
Long delivery time but worth the wait. The material is good !
Item received in awesome condition. Was contemplating if shld keep it but still kept instead cps abit short for my liking n colour is meh
"delivery took q some time :-( but other than that, product quality is great!!! material is suitable for workout and good support from the padding (not sure if its adequate for high intensity workout tho)"
NICE HAHAHAHAH i just tried it and it fits well !!! will buy more again
"Love them....good quality, worth the money. Purchased them when there is a great sale."
"Size runs big so seller told me to stick to size S, thank you! It fits well."
Colour is true to what I expected ! It’s not very cropped. V comfy! 
Good quality work out top. Minus one start as the colour seems more towards brown than red wine.. 
Size abit too big 
It’s really good quality and thick! I’m a usual M size for Nike sports bra and this size fits me very well too! Love the colour as well 
very pretty piece!! 
bigger than expected
The neck line is a little loose. 
"comfortable fit! The tank top has an elastic on the inside for support. But because its kow cut, i dont recommend using it for high intensity workouts (esp jumping)"
Very comfortable!
"Took very long to come but very very pleased with the quality. Will repurchase. Am a UK8, 173cm tall. "
Material is not bad. Got a size S for UK6. Not really firm support. But still wearable. Good price!
"Received well, thank you seller! Item is of not bad quality, except just wished the straps were adjustable. Followed reviews to size up and it fits really well. Love the colour, will definitely buy again! "
Quality is pretty good for the price point! I'm a UK8-10 and M fits me well but slightly loose at the chest area. Love the colour! 
"Bought 3 items, all were of good quality and super worth the money! "
2nd purchase. It’s comfy and not bad for a discount price of the top! 
Received in good condition. Thou size quite small for L size. 
"Love the quality! However, it does not provide much support, and will be quite revealing. It's ok for workout at home."
Received item in good package. I like the design after trying out. Thank you to seller.
Haven't tried it on but received it quite fast I guess. I hope it's nice.
So cuteeeee i love the quality 
Received in good condition. Good quality. Highly recommended. The colour is really pretty. 
Looks and feel really good! Will purchase again. 
Received in approximately 2 weeks! Quite fast considering the circuit breaker. Yet to try
"Delivery took about 2 weeks, delivered via road bull. Really pretty color and fits well. "
Very good material and speedy delivery. S just nice for a petite person. Not really stretchable. Next tym would get a M size instead esp after sweat the top definitely will feel tighter.
Items received! Took a while but understandable due to the current situation. Quality seems good! 
material is good especially with this kind of price. delivery take a while to arrive
Received in good condition. Delivery was relatively fast considering COVID. 
Item received in good condition and delivery on time. Good quality. Will purchase again (:
"true to colour. fit slightly snug( ~55kg, 163cm), not sure if it built in cup can support during exercise though. "
Love the quality and the fit! Very comfortable!
"Material seems good, and very worth it during time sale!!!!"
Pretty comfortable to wear and colour is true as shown. Decent delivery rate 
Very happy with my purchase. Fits well and is not too low cut as I had feared.
"Received 2 weeks after ordering. Material seems good, better than expected! Recommended!"
"No push up. 2 combined layers, 1 bra, 1 singlet. Comfortable. Feels good on skin. Would recommend. Delivery by singpost."
Very good product. Quality is good. ThKs 
"Took about a week, material is good and looks comfortable!!"
"Love their sports bra! Cheap and good, nice colors too. Will keep buying "
Good quality! True to color
So good and as per describe in the photo! Look exactly the same and will definitely purchase again in future and its very cute
"Super good! Really happy with the model and the material is soft and thick, not see through. Im 158cm 48kg and get S size. Fit my body perfectly!"
Nice material but a little small for me will get an L next time :-) 
"items took quite a while to receive but understandable. really recommend this product as the material is VERY comfortable! might order again, thankyou seller!"
I love this material but unsure if numerous wash will expand the top? But overall awesome purchase !
Item exact to picture shown! Have yet to try! But material is great
True to picture! But I bought a size too big so it’s great for lounging around the house :)
"Received in good condition. Material is of good quality, worth the buy! Green is more of a pastel turquoise "
"Quite tight at the bust area, the padding was too high for me. Quality is good though. "
Body hugging material. Comes with bra padding. Material thin and cooling.
Nice fitting but abit tight. Luckily the material is stretchy 
"Bought a size M, but was a bit small.  Bust size is 34inch, under bust 28.5inch. Maybe put on weight due to Covid. Delivery was slow due to current situation but the quality of the top was thicker than expected and feels comfy."
Arrived in perfect condition and fits me to a T. Definitely ordering more colours from them again. What a steal! 
Is a nice material. Quick delivery 
Amazing quality and the size was just right! 
Great material and nice quality but strap a bit long but still good 
Love the materials it’s Super comfortable.  colour true to picture  Definitely buying again 
Super comfy good quality love it. 
Nice colour! Material is really good too! Delivery was relatively fast. Will buy from them again! (: 
good material! even though delivery take awhile but everything is fine :) 
"bought white S. I am 171cm/57kg/36B/34C/S/XS for reference. I feel like my chest is spilling out a little. Maybe M would be more suitable for similar size girls out there :) Material is otherwise smooth, soft and feels like good quality. "
"Repeat buyer. I have this TOP in 3 colors, really like the material, very comfy and body fitting"
really great quality and fit  highly recommend 
"Good quality and comfortable, might purchase more in the future "
Would not recommend for full busted women. Support is not enough. Makes my boobs look saggy
Fits well! 
I am a UK10 and size M fits well. Nice colour too. Repeat buys from the seller.
Item received in good conditions. Like the material and it fits just nice. Thanks  
Item took 2 weeks or more to arrive due to current situation.
ahh super comfy & very nice colour. will buy more next time :-) 
"Good material and correct size.. the colour is also as per described, will buy again in future. "
Took 2 weeks but came in good condition. Good quality. Usually uk10 size L fits just nice 
Comfortable and nice! Value for price.
"Low cut, strap not adjustable. Suitable for casual wear. :)"
Delivery speed was quite fast considering the covid19 situation. Love the material! 
Received and yet to try it on. But quality looks decent for the price paid
" I wanted to love this to go braless and use it a a daily top. Sadly doesn't for as well as the criss cross sports bra. The cutting for the front feels odd, could be cause I've non-existent boobs :( Those with assets, should be able to order this. If not, skip it. "
"Received in 1.5 weeks. Does not provide much support for girls with bigger assets, causing it to move around a lot during workout. Strap is non adjustable too."
Delivery arrived faster than expected! Repeat purchase. Good enough quality for its price. Great if you don’t want to spend too much on branded activewear. Have not worked out in it yet though.
"Received well, great quality and product colour  true to picture! Worth it! "
Love my purchase good material !! Third purchase !
Branding and label seems different but quality feels good and nice still! 
"Best buy!!! Quality is really good and the top is comfortable, straps isn’t adjustable but the top isn’t very low so it’s ok. But if you’re not used to crop tops then this might be too short for you. "
Fast delivery and good quality sports clothes. Not so stretchable but should be big enough. 
Good quality for the price paid. If have sale again I will repurchase. There was some mix up with the courier company but the seller was polite and helped me. Thanks. recommended. 
So nice and comfy! Colours true to the photos! Will purchase again! 
Item received in bad box condition and the delivery is very fast. From the video u could see the box is in dented condition but the massager could few mode by pressing the on button. However dunno if this is the used item or demo set as it don’t look like new item
"2nd purchase due to flash deals @ $22.90. Very worth it! However initially the plug for charging wasnt able to fit into the gun, aft some force then was able to fit in "
"Super fast delivery! Item has a solid feel. Vibrations are very strong even at level 1. Only issue is that one of the heads keep dropping off when switched on, other heads are fine."
super happy with seller's super fast delivery. my order came in just 2 days. kudos for the superb speedy service and thanks to ninjavan for getting it delivered.
Super fast delivery! Good deal. Helps with muscle ache
Received item. Tried once its good massager 
"Everything is perfect but it can be quite revealing for girls with bigger bust. Love the quality, would be better if straps are adjustable!"
"75C and i usually wear M. this size fits me well, very comfortable i love it. don’t need to wear bra bc alr have padding. will definitely buy more in other colours. thank you! "
"Super good quality! Should have up 1 size for the sport bra, it’s too tight for me. I’m a UK6 for top. "
Good material!!
good quality top! doesn’t really look like a workout top if you’re more busty 
"Delivery received safely. Product is very good and useful. Recommend   Ordered on 14 Apr, Received on 2 May. "
The padding is quite thick. Material is soft too. Like it! Thanks!
Did not receive items yet still got to leave review.... doesn’t makes sense. 
Size is smaller than norm. Should get 1 size bigger. Only slightly stretchable.
will definitely purchased it again!! fits just well for 75C
not bad it’s quite fitting and colour is like described in the photos 
The material is good and does not lose this elasticity at all. But it doesn’t support the girls well so I don’t recommend this bra for high intensity workouts. 
So beautiful!! Really excited for it! Delivery takes awhile but might due to current pandemic. Material is really good!!
material is thick and padding is thick. overall a decent buy for the price. worth to buy during flash sale xxxxxx colour is nice too. haven’t tried on but first impressions it is great. might purchase in the future again if it is on flash sale good buy overall 
Size runs small. May want to size up. 
fits well 
Love the top super comfy and stretchy 100% would buy in other colours thanks seller 
Items came quickly and well packed. Really like the colour and the material
Fab quality for its pricing! Good for WFH days (: Side of top is slightly loose but I Guess that’s not a problem. 
"Arrived in good packaging, material seems not too bad!!!!!"
love it. thick quality and it’s padded so it’s extremely convenient- no need to wear anything below. able to do hiit workout although it will rise up alittle but overall good
Good condition. But shipping quite slow
Not satisfied with item but seller refuses to refund despite 15 day return policy 
Wow! I ordered on 20 july and got it today on 21 july! Yooooo this is by far the fastest delivery I got from years buying from shopee. Hahaha. Yes item well received and time for me to enjoy my massage!
Received in good order. Tested and working fine. Recommended 
"Love the material, it’s very comfy and very satisfied with the color!"
Very pretty top and the quality is good too! Took some time to arrive as it is shipped from overseas.
"Item received as described and shown in pictures. Quality is better than expected! However, the support provided makes this more suitable for brisk walking/yoga etc. "
Love the colour! Fit me very well! Quality is good too! Definitely will get another colour! 
The maroon ended up looking more bright red than wine red but the quality is consistent
"Delivery took awhile but worth the wait!! Repeated buyer!! Colour was pretty,love it! "
Item arrived in good condition and well packaged. Top fit nicely. Usually wear M size. 
"Don’t really like the TOP part, a bit excess cloth?? Idk how to say but colour and size wise is ok. It’s pretty thick for a workout TOP also. "
Good.  Love the material and fit.  But cleavage may be shown depending on cup size. 
"Looks more like grey than green. Strips are a bit too long for me, good pushup effects with the pads "
Took around 2 weeks
"Nice, material is a bit thick though. And I think I chose wrong sizing a bit big for me. Will conisder get one in smaller size, and am soooooo glad the colour doesnt run when washing!!!"
Pants comfortable. TOP was not very fitting. Overall happy with purchase 
Thanks sellers.very fast delivery.and very good product.
"Order took quite a while to deliver, but seller was very prompt in answering my queries regarding the product. Overall very satisfied with the condition of the product and service of the seller "
Very nice 
Acceptable delivery. New item. Give it 4  bkos all 3 msg guns not as strong on level 1 as the very 1st msg gun bought from same seller. It's like the 6th intensity = 1 of d 1st gun.  1 of d 3 guns could not be on. Funny plug not on but got green light. . Seller is VERY RESPONSIVE to queries! 
"Ordered black but came in red! Delivery took awhile! Item is dent & 1 tool is missing. Called/ msg no one answer, took them awhile to reply. Told me stock will come in last week but didn't update at all. Disappointed. You get what you paid for "
Just received but yet to try. Hope that this is useful to relax my muscle after workout. 
"Back to get the second one. The sound is loud but it works with the purpose. A good alternative, got the second one at a flash deal "

"Super fast delivery! Ordered on 20 Jul, received the next day via Ninja Van. Tested & all working fine. Good deal   "
"Bought during flash deal at 22.90, and there’s 10% cash back with coupon. Quite heavy so you can use it’s weight instead of pressing hard, but some areas will be difficult to massage by yourself like your back. Helps to relieve my shoulder aches and sciatic pain. "
Box was torn when received. Hopefully the product works well. Not sure if it’s used before? Seller do let me know if the item is new? Can you exchange the box for me? I want to give it as a gift. Now the whole item looks so old and used.
Massage gun arrived timely and it works well. The vibration may not be as strong but it is okays
Order wrapped nicely. Test and in good working condition..
Everything in good condition. Delivery was fast.  Pretty useful for relive of tight muscle.  
Fast delivery. Doesn't seem to last as long as stated. Seller has said to bring down to shop to check. Hope issue will be solved. 
Works!

2nd purchase
Good quality and cheap.. fast delivery.  recommended 
Well received. Delivery took a while as out of stock according to seller. Overall is good for the price.
Very good item really appreciated that it came quick! Bought during sale and is as described!
I wish the seller can do an exchange for me as they delivered me the wrong Color.......... but seller only replied me an emoji and never say anything else....... a little disappointed like I have to just make do with it 
Bought this for the second time for my boyfriends mother cause she said it’s good. Include instructions on the muscles 
"Affordable, reliable, practical, and good"
"Item delivered the very next day, impressed with that! Yet to try it out. Item came well secured and packaged. "
Very long shipping and seller said ready in stock before we ordered which is not ready in stock not honest with the customer We knew only when double check and follow up the items
Pretty decent for the price. Just a minor scratch on the gun but still worth it.
Good product and fast delivery.
Quick delivery and quick test seem to be ok. Will get my son to test again
Cheaper than auction. Takes a while for seller to send out for delivery but no issues for me. It comes with manual to explain which extension to use for which part of the body and how long too. Useful tool.
Thanks seller. Fast delivery..
Tested and very strong . I find the round one the most suitable . The other is too focus and strong . Maybe the massage tip can put on some soft padding to enhance the pleasant . 
Awesome quality. I will definitely buy again
"Received in good conditions, tested and very happy with my new toys."
Received in good condition thanks! 
Item as advertised and delivered super fast! 
Item works and packaging was good. Only drawback is no lvl indication of the battery level on the physical device
Good and power
received order... it's working well and is just what i needed to ease the tireness of my back... really come handy in using it.. 
Received the facial gun but yet to test it.
Item received well packaged and in good condition. Used it and it does help with muscle tension. Manual on how to use the various head extensions and on which body parts is really helpful. 
Nice  
Received 1 spoilt item out of 2. 
Good stuff. 
Item received. Box slightly dented. Yet to try out the product
Second purchase. Great for elderly

Great items thanks seller.
Very fast delivery with quick response from seller

Good product. Fast delivery. Bought a few units. 
Good to use 
Item receive in good condition .. super fast
Box was abit dented but delivery was quite fast. Received with 3 days on sunday. Tested and works well. Just like an device with pressure. Its quite heavy to hold for long. Overall seems ok and hopefully it helps for pain and aches.
Delivery was fast and item well received. I bought it for a gift and it was well loved.
Item was received well packaged. Tried it briefly and works well. Instructions could be more detailed for better experience and correct usage. 
Fast delivery with good packaging 
Received item but missed out 1 part. Contacted seller and replacement part was sent immediately. Good buy.
"Item is not working. Dm the seller. Feels like seller's replies are automated. Was asking for 1 to 1 exchange. Was then asked to call their office. When called DURING their office operating hours, nobody picks up. Informed them about it and still giving me the same answr. Very disappointed."
Excellent. Fast delivery. Took 2 days to reach me. Item working very well 
"Received item in good packing condition, the item is worth buying too. It works for my husband muscle ache etc."
Packaging n items all good... 
"Delivery took 4 working days to arrived. However when I first order, it took 2weeks and shopee has automatically cancelled because pick up service was delayed from seller side. The gun is pretty heavy, approximately 1.5kg or more. Not yet try, hopefully it is value for money!"
Thanks
Good value
Fast delivery ... thanks . My son loves it... in time for his physio session 
"All good except the box is dented at one corner. Did a short test, not as powerful as I expected. "
power..... even there’s  some delay on delivery but worth the waiting ... thanks you 
Surprising sturdy and great built quality especially given the price. Love it and works well and can’t be any happier w my purchase. 
Took 6days to ship..evrrything ok.
Well received. Product working well. Really satisfied with my purchase. 
Delivery was slow though I can see from comments other shoppers bought later than me but received theirs earlier. It's quite heavy and the handle is large so smaller hands will find it tiring to hold for long. But it's reasonably priced and has good pounding power. Single charge enough for ~2hrs
Work excellent. Thanks 
Delivery was delayed and took a while to receive but item works great! Thanks!
"Delivery  was a little slow but overall okay. Yet to try, hopefully it will work well:)"
Cheap and good item!! It came really well packaged and works well too! Bought one previously using another platform at a much higher price but this works better!! Thank you seller! 
Good purchase. it helps to relief the soreness on your body. but the gun is a little heavy. 
Received in good condition. Not powerful enough thou
Haven’t try yet and delivery will take 10 days.
Seller took awhile to send out. Item was as described. But kinda annoying how you have to press the power button a few times to off it. 
Super good. This is my 3rd purchase! 
Ok not powerful enough for Large guys but great for ladies  
Item received with good condition and fast delivery... 
Item received well. But the y attachment lose when try to attach it. Anyway still work well with other attachment.
Good quality..fast shipping..thanks 
Receive it fast. Items look solid. What the!! Just try my massager not function. No power!! So dissapoited My gosh!!! 
Item received in good condition...Bought it for 2nd time...
Have yet to use it properly but tried it for a short while to give it a test. 
As advertised 
Item received packaged well! Charged for 3h on first use and massager is working well too!
"Ordered on 19th, received on 25th. Quite heavy. Price as per quality. Will recommend to try for fun and decide if it suits you.."
Ordered on 9 June.  Ninjavan picked up on 18 June.  Received on 20 June.  Poor rating mainly because of poor cust serv. Seller is slow to ship out despite some customers able to receive fast. No apology from seller when i found out they hv lied. Nevertheless items rcvd in working n gd cond. 
"Ordered 9 June, arrived 19 June. Seller shipped out item really late (took like 5 days to ship, had to extend shopee guarantee) but Ninjavan was quick on delivery after."
Item received in good condition. Box was slightly dented in several corners but nevertheless the item inside is intact. Tried it and is really good for sore muscles. 
Received mailing in bubble wrap package. Tested out the product and works well as per description
Very good...nice to play..fast delivery..recommended
Good Quality with nice box!  
Took 7 days to receive.  Product arrived in good shape and working order. 
well-package. but slightly heavy. overall good purchase! 
All is good.. reaching fast also..
Not bad for price. Body feels light and better after using. 
Wow super fast!! Didnt expect this fast. ordered on 17 Jun. And received today 18Jun. Item was good and well packaged. Just same like in the photos. Gonna try the item soon
Received in good condition. Just tired it.... Feels big on hand.... For the price it's good enough:)
"Delivery: **** Massager arrived in days. Quite fast in this pandemic lockdown.  Product: **** Using 2 diff heads and in minutes, this effectively loosen-soften our years of painful trigger knots! USE ONLY FOR MINUTES every time. Strong hitting vibe shakes your whole body like JACKHAMMER! Thank you!"
"Love the massage gun, tho it mostly relies on the vibration pressure to soothe your knots. Easy to assemble. Only downside is, it takes 10days for the items to be shipped out. "
Have not tried as it was for a gift. But I have bought this before. The motor is strong for sure. Thanks Seller
"received in good condition, but the head for the gun can’t be ‘locked in’, so as i was testing out, the head dropped out so have to make sure it’s all the way in all the time "
Good quality item. Received in good condition.
Speedy delivery. Working well. 
"delivery in 3 days! got it at flash sale for 22.90, very worth it, alleviated my muscle pain very well "
nicely packed and try it good for massage...
Worthy to buy!
Good material and very recommended!!!!!!! Really helps 
My 2nd purchase... Thank you for ensure the boxes are not damage and had bubble wrap it for me. I received them in good condition. Appreciated!  It will be perfect if the shipping time can improve. 
"Product is good and working well. Manual was okay too. Shipping though was delayed. Don't understand how some other user's ratings mention that they received their item after for example, 2 days or 5 days. I got mine exactly 2 weeks after ordering. Other than that, no issue, item is good."
Received today after some delay. Item come bubble wrapped. Rather heavy. Yet to try.
"Items received but yet to try,  thanks"
Received in good condition and fast delivery...tested it 
The product is quite amazing but no sure how come the effect is different when I do on myself and getting someone to do for me. Better to do on myself. Feel ticklish when hubby did it for me n he has the similar experience. 
Massage gun received. Some attachments are quite sharp so you need shave off the plastic a bit to prevent agitating your skin. 
There was a slight delay. But love the item. Thinking of getting 1 more for my parents if this last for a month. 
Super worth it for the price! Think I will be using this regularly... 
Bought it as a gift . Come in a good wrapped parcel . Hope there is no damage inside . Thank u for the fast delivery
Ordered on 13/6 at flash deal and received on 18/6 by ninja home delivery. Item well wrapped. Tested on it. It’s in working condition. 
Delivery take a while. Try it not bad. Bought it during flash sale. 
Item came as per described. 
I received but spoil cannot use at all.
"Delivery took a few days. Seems ok, can work 6 speeds as advertised but not sure how ""strong"" it will be. "
"Received in 2 days. Bought for $20, and it's worth every dollar! "
Saw this at facebook auction and they're selling for like 50 over dollars so this is a good steal. Good price for its quality. Super strong. Only downside is the delivery is long but acceptable during this pandemic and seller will update about its delivery status.. thank you :)
Would recommend!
Item received in good condition.. not yet try though......
So happy with the item. It's so good for my parents and me to use it. Great deal. Thanks you
Order received in good condition and we are pleased the product. For this price it is worth getting 
The item came within two days securely packed. Had to charge it first. The vibration is strrong. Level one is enough. Great product. 
"Bought for the 2nd time, great quality, good product, worth it! Really muscle relaxing!! "
Really helped ease muscle ache & improves blood circulation. This is my second order.
Good and fast delivery. Will buy again
Good item. Quality of the big ball feels like a sponge and poor quality. Other heads are good 
Was told that they didn’t have existing stock despite the huge number of stocks listed in shopee. Item was sent out only after 2 weeks upon ordering. I ordered in black. But received silver. Very bad service.
Package was a bit battered but no issues with the product. Thank you. 
"Delivery, not as fast as I expected, but anyway, thanks seller for the timely effective communication. Tested the item. Item came with battery charged, everything works fine. Good buy and highly recommended."
"Fits well, 6 speed control and best priced. "
"Delivery took a while. Read instructions manual, asked to charge 3 hrs b4 first use. However the color indicator and whats written on the manual doesnt match. but lucky seller replied upon questioning. Tried using and it relieve the tense muscles. good buy overall. "
"Ordered 05 june Ninja van pickup 16 june Received 18 june - rather heavy - noise a bit loud But overall is good Great seller to deal with, Items were delivered promptly, Speedy replies and the items were at best quality!  Will definitely purchase more in future!  Highly Recommended"
Item came in good condition but the box was damaged. Worth the buy na 
My 2nd order. Good
"Fast delivery. Very powerful.good product.    When charging,  there is no light to show whether it is charging g or not. I google from the website and it shows that the power button have the charging light when charging. The item I have received do not have. Any problem? Can seller advise on this?"
"Delivered to my doorstep within 3 days....even on a Sunday! I'm super impressed! Item worked as described and it's not as loud as I was expecting from reading the comments here. I'm really quite happy with this purchase, to be quite honest! Well done, guys! "
This is almost the same as those expensive ones sold in department stores! Finishing is a little rough but works just as well to massage those sore muscles! Hope the lifespan will be just as good! and the seller sent this out very quickly too! Thanks  
"Bloody great buy!!!! Soo orgasmic! Make your hair stand using this machine!!! From your shoulder to your neck, to the back, your buttock and ties and feet!!! Burrrrr!!!  Must buy!...I think better than massage shop."
waaaaaaaaassassassassassssassssaaaaaaaaaasassasassasassas
"Well received! So satisfied , it’s so powerful. Tried on my mum she said it’s a great product! May consider to buy one more "

It goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"Order received in around 2 weeks’ time. Delivery was relatively fast, but shipping took too long. Item well packed and seems to work fine."
Bought on a flash sales. So far battery can only last abt 45 mins on even the lowest speed. Product is ok. Noise level manageable. Weight to use is acceptable for me. All good
Items received as per description given. Prompt delivery.
Took awhile but order finally arrived. Came in good working condition.
Simply love it. I bought another o e
"Bought it during the sale & delivery was slower than expected. i extended the delivery date but it was shipped even later.  Had tried the product and its not bad but the thing that came with it, keeps coming out when im using it."

"A lil bit of dented on the boxes, nevertheless item received in good condition.   Thank you Shopee and Ninja for the delivery."
"was not a pleasant experience buying from this seller. seller kept delaying shipment and I had to keep asking them when it will be shipped. ordered on 6/6 but item only shipped out 15/6 at night. but overall item was ok, a bit heavy but good enough for the price."
Not bad. Wasn’t expecting much as it was cheaper than most that are selling out in the market... overall usable! But took quite while to delivery. Seller however took initiative to update about late delivery. 
"Well packed. Delivery was fast, in 3 days I received the item. Product work pretty well, super love it. "
Box was dented but item is in good condition. Comes with a user manual. The manual teaches you which head to use and to use for how long on each body part. Make sure you read the manual before use. It's very useful. Recommended. 
Fast delivery. Thanks 
Fast ship. One of the attachment the spine 2 pins are loose. Won't stay in position.
Received in good condition. Different speed to choose from and it felt great for tense muscles. Slightly heavy as mentioned by others but not much an issue if someone does ur back for you. Would recommend it! 
"OK 4 DAYS after order and delivery , tested everything ok nice."

Nice n powerful..

Box was dented when deliver. No damage to the device. Pretty good tool to reduce muscle soreness. 
"Well packed, prompt delivery. Tried on, feels OK but not tested on the bike yet. "

Bought this for my dad 1.75m around 70kg . Good fit. Sizing on the small side so size up if you are border line . Quality is good for price paid. Padding seems slightly thick. Fast delivery from seller. 
item received in good condition
"Good quality, padding is thick. Large size fits me perfectly "
Really comfy and thick padding. Followed chart and is accurate 
I have purchased X-Tiger 5D Padded Cycling Shorts Shockproof MTB. I have not tried yet. It looks good.

Ordered on 7/7. Arrived on 13/7. Nice item and fits well. 
"Delivery is fast, seller is always very prompt on question, the quality is superb, this is my third time buying from this seller, will give 6 star rating. "

Comfortable. Excellent quality. Good buy.

Good quality and fit nicely! 
"Waist 36"" bought XL. Fit nicely tight. Good quality for price. Don't regret. Delivery to Singapore about 1 week. Recommended "
Item rcvd. First ever bike riding shorts. Looking forward to wear it for my next ride.
The shorts are ok. The material is a bit different to normal lycra biking shorts. A little thicker than normal lycra shorts. The gel pads are good and comfortable to bike in. Good value for the price
"received in good condition, nice quality of clothing.."
The Short’s 5D Padding is good.  I wore it and rode for 3 hours without feeling any dumbness on butt area at all!  Strongly recommend any biker who is considering bicycle shorts to get this!
"got it for my dad, he love the colour of the pants!  delivery was about a week. "
Nice and comfortable to use 
Received in less than a week. Packed nicely and fits perfectly. A good quality padding material. Definitely will purchase again.
Item is as advertised and fit per size chart. And delivery was timely.
Good quality. Size is correct. Will buy again
Second time purchasing. They didnt have one of the items but didnt let me know. Shopee cancelled the order and i had to repurchase for 20% more expensive. Price still ok but overall experiance this time was not as good s first purchase
"Delivery was fast despite the ongoing pandemic, padding quality is good "
Thank u!!
Received goods well. Thank you
Very good 
"Looks good, padding is quite thick so should serve its purpose."
Product looks ok  but havent  try it yet... Mens cycling pads look nice.ladies cycling pads soso. 
Highly recommended will buy again
Great to have received so soon but haven't tried. Checks for good packaging
Order well received. Size is quite good as it fit my 162/73 frame well. It is alittle tight but should be good after a few wash
Received correct colour and size! Delivery was quite fast considering the situation now. Have yet to try but seems good.
Made such a different to my bike ride!! Would buy again 
Looks small but fits alright. Fast shipping lookz good and cooling material. Worth the buy.
Item received. Fit well and like the cushioning pad! 
This XL isa larger than the previous one
"2nd purchase. Very comfortable pair of shorts, whereas no issue for my Brompton as its a comfort saddle but proven on my ass killer full carbon fiber road bike saddle. Design might be abit loud n too fancy for some cyclists but for the price n quality I'm getting, I dun mind at all. "
Arrived in a week. Fits well. Good quality & workmanship. I like it!
Very prompt delivery and is worth for the price . Thank you 
"Great item,  value for money,  good quality,  definitely a good buy "
"My husband likes it. He said it's of good quality for the price paid. Thank you, seller! "
"item received abit later time but overall,satisfied!"
Good shorts at a good price
Item received in good order. Size slightly smaller than expected though.
"Good quality. Nice cushion for my butt! Fast delivery. Bought 2, Will buy 2 more!"
Padded shorts. The size was ok. Matched well with the other items bought. 
"Delivery took a full wk, still reasonable given the difficult period. Good quality fabric, comfortable and look good too. Size chart is accurate so buy with peace of mind. Gonna to stock up a few pcs more. "
Overall quality is ok. Not a bad product but delivery is long.
"item came as described and true to size!! good deal, will purchase again"
Great product quality and size fits perfectly using the size chart as a reference. 
good quality gel pad and comfortable
Great seller and good quality product received 
Good and worth buying. Lessen my saddle pain. Might be getting a 2nd one if use long term
"Fast delivered. Fit just nice for me.. waist 38, size 3XL... Material quality is good too. Will buy again..."
Received my order. Size fit exactly.
Received good condition item very nice thanks and fast delivery give
"Decent but size feels smaller quite tight for m , good for now, will buy again."
"Received it and it exceeded my expectations. Have yet to try but can tell that it will definitely be of great fit, design is flattering and really pretty! Will buy more from seller! Thank you! "
"Love this design. Total have 3 colour. Need to up size.  However, there new products is getting more and more expensive. So so sad. Previously their products is really affortable and nice. Not worth to buy if more than $15 for top. "
My 3rd purchase from this store! Absolutely loving the design and material! Enough support to do HIIT workouts and long runs. Good support too. The wine red looks like vibrant red though.. but it's still nice! 
This is my 5th order from Moving Peach. Glad to see an item with their brand tag finally. Cutting is indeed small. This L is like Lululemon 6. Actual product nicer than the advertised pics. 
"Very comfortable! Second time purchasing from here, and will probably get more in future!"
My fifth purchase from moving peach. Suitable for running and even going out. Very comfortable material. Will buy more even without flash sales! 
Delivery speed is good! Received in good condition! My second and third purchase. Personally I prefer this one as the cutting is a lot more fitting and the colour is pretty! 
Very soft and comfortable. It is quite supportive and fits well. Sizing is accurate. 
"I have another piece from moving peach as seen on video, just want to show the difference in padding even though both are “push up” in the description title. Both size and thickness are different. There is no push up at all for this top. Would give 5* if seller didn’t put “push up” in title. "
"Took a week to arrive. Smooth, buttery soft material. Lilac grey seems slightly larger than white. Fits nicely. I’m 1.6m, UK6 to 8 for tops, 75B. Consult seller if unsure of size! "
"Came pretty quickly. Would probably have gotten size M instead. I’m a 75B and I usually get clothes in the size 38. It still fits, but it’s a little loose, especially the waist. I think the length of this piece is a little awkward because it’s a little too long. But overall, it’s not bad!"
"Own multiple colours of this too, nice material and hold to them. Size S is a little small for me (Uk 6, 168cm, 24-25inch waist) would suggest sizing up!"
"I have this bra in four colours, pink is a new colour but it is not the baby pink shade."
damn comfu nice. my mum want also but she say need XL but seller no XL?
All is goooooood!!!! The material is jus nice as well!!!!!!(:
Absolutely love it! Tried it on and it fits well. I’m a sucker for sports attire and surprisingly this looks really good and can’t wait to wear it for hiking or outdoor sport!
Fit nicely!! Bought during flash sales hehehehe! Worth the price!
Tops - Fits well. Quality good! Will buy fr seller again.
Super nice and comfortable! Supportive and very nice to wear. Good to workout in. 
"Item came as described, just that it appears a little shorter than how it looks. Great material & very comfortable! "
"Tried working out in them and it feels so comfortable. I’m 163cm,46kg for those who’s contemplating on the size.  Usually S size for cotton on."
"Am going to return because it is way too small. Need to check the sizing yourself. Previously I ordered L it’s too small. For this series L seems to be a good fit, so am gonna order L. I’m"
"Received it quickly. Unfortunately did not realize it was so tight, can't be worn comfortably, will get a bigger size next time"
Very nice sports bra!! Read reviews to size up and Glad I did. Will definitely buy again
"I’ve bought from moving peach 3 times and it’s a miss, miss and a hit this time. I had the sizes for S and M and they didn’t allow me to return it. So I had to keep it along with a legging that’s didn’t fit me.   For this product, the Color have diff quality. Pink better than white. Always order L. "
"Item fits well (less snug/supportive for M size but i scared S wont be able to fit), material feels great too! Would buy again :)"
First time buying from moving peach as there was a flash sale. Always read good reviews about their product. I love the comfortable material. Wish it was cheaper though since it is from China. 
Nice material and cutting. Unfortunately one of the padding was squashed when received but seller suggest resend the padding upon next purchase. Will definitely considering buying again!
Received in good condition. Material is good. 157-158cm. 47kg. Just nice. Happy with purchase.
"Really love the quality and colour of the sports bra! Was contemplating if I should size up and I’m glad I did. The sports bra is not tight at all. For reference I’m 155cm, 47kg and I usually wear s-m. Will purchase in other colours soon "
im a 70B and i tried the sports bra on top of my normal drifit shirt + bra and it fits! although it's quite tight but still able to wear and remove smoothly. might get one size up (M) next time for comfort!
Received in good condition. Usually wear S for tops but looking through reviews to size up and M fits perfectly. Its good for yoga but support may not be as good for HIIT. Removable paddings. 
"2nd purchase for this top and i love it so much! Uk8 and size L fits me fine. Looove it, even more worth when i got it during flash sales for $12+. :)"
Ordered from moving peach many times & their products never fail!!!! Quality is super good for the price paid & definitely would purchase more!!!!!! 
Item came as per picture :) Quality is pretty good! Bought Size M and fits really well for a UK6-8 with some allowance at the sides. 
"Great fit, good material. I'm a UK8 and L fits great, though probably could have sized down if I wanted a tighter fit :)"
"Decent delivery - about 2 weeks or so. Highly recommend this sports bra, rather good quality and comfortable to wear  "
"Fast delivery. Previously bought M size for other design but too tight, L just nice. Follow the advice to size up. Design is nice ,sports bra is comfy too. "
Fast delivery and quality of the product is good. The size fit well and is good to size up. 
Padding is slightly big! Other than that the quality of the sports bra feels good! 
I feel need more material at the armpit part. Bought M size.  Sizing runs small. 
Bought black and white ones the 1st time round. Love the back design. This time snapping up the remaining colours. Fit well and are comfortable. 
"Soft and comfortable material, repeated purchase as I own this top in 4 colours. Happy with purchase!"
"2nd purchase, bought the green color previously. I like the design and material. Recommended to buy."
"i’m a usa 6 for bottoms, 94cm on bust. received all items tgth, all is worth it’s price. the length is longer than other sports bras, would recommend as it defines your hour glass figure / body shape more. comfy too."
This is my second time purchasing. This time the shipping was quite fast. Both colours are very nice colours! Nude purple and rose pink. The material is very good and definitely worth the price. Thank you seller for arranging the delivery promptly and packing the items nicely! 
"Delivery is fast. Quality is good and cheap. Sports bra looks similiar to picture. If you are usually a size M, you should plus 1 size up. Large size is just nice for me. "
Very fast delivery. love the material. 60kg 157cm and L fits really well. worth the buy. 
Exactly like the picture! Fits well will purchase the other colours!
"fast delivery, friendly and trusted seller, multiple buys already!"
Bought it a second time for my sister! Fits nicely and pretty pattern. 
Very nice workout bra! Took an advice from previous review to size up. Normally M but taking L size this time but it fits perfectly! Will consider buy again! 
Very nice material. Worth buying!
Item received as per description. Fast delivery within 3-5 days. 
"Second purchase, and I like how comfortable it is :) thanks seller!"
"good material very fitting but i must say, i was disappointed when i bought thesize S version. thought it would fit me (i’m a 32B size) but it was too tight and i wanted to return but seller advised me to buy a new one with discount becuz returning one piece is not worth it. luckily the M fits"
Took awhile to reach me. Was my second purchase and I love it as much as the first. Size up for comfy fit. It was very stretchy and flattering. Easy in easy out. 
"Both M fits me well! Usually my Adidas sports bra is S, but this one fits nicely. Tights also very comfortable! Highly recommended, just the bra, material wise not that ideal. So far ok! "
I'm in between M and L and these are so comfortable! Good quality! 160cm 60kg
"Very nice! 2nd purchase and very comfy, good for light exercises. "
"Great color, great fit and great sizing. I’m pretty petite but the S fits me really well. Would buy again!! "
"I'm 158cm, 55kg and I really love the top!! Is super comfortable and smooth. It doesnt moves a lot when exercising but the bottom does comes up if you stretches like any other clothes do. Will buy again! "
"definitely flattering. bought the white one and was worried my fats might be bulging out or sth but that didnt happen!! it was nice  i usually wear M (60kg, 171cm, bust 34B, waist 27cm) but sized up to L and it fits perfectly! low support so probably will use it when hiking or yoga "
love the color! very nice material! probably gonna get more pieces!̈  
"Thanks for sending out, I have received the item. Material feels a bit different from first purchase though."
The size fits me well and the quality is quite good as well. I hope they can have more deals in the future.
received in good condition and within 10 days. worth during flash deals
Quality of the sports bra is good! This is my 2nd purchase from this brand. Material is quite comfy and is suitable for light cardio and yoga or pilates.
Very very very happy with this purpose. The material is good and grip is good. Suitable for yoga and HIIT. Nice design too. Worth it. 
"Delivery was very fast. The quality was good for the price, and it gives medium support. Not suitable for those more active sports like skipping or running.."
"The colour is a bit brighter in real life - lilac grey, true to its name. I’m usually S/M but sized up to L because i didn’t want it to be too short - recommend to size up so won’t be too tight too "
Size too small ! Must size up up for this product. 
Item came in less than 2 weeks! 4th time purchasing. All the items bought are Super comfy on the skin. 
Material is thicker than normal sports bra. Can be worn as a casual top.
"I’m 167cm and ~44kg. Usually wear S, but reviews said better to upsize, so I got M instead and it fits well."
"received in good condition, the material is good and is quite fitting for me. colour is more twds maroon. "
"Size fits well, material is comfortable, but there is no printed logo on the sports bra itself, not sure about its authenticity?"
"Excellent material, very soft and comfortable. Nice ziplock packaging "
Comfortable and excellent material. Came in nice zip lock packaging 
"This is my second time purchasing! Bought during flash deals, and it’s a steal for the quality and fit. "
"Both top & bottom from the same shop. Fits nicely, I like the colour. "
Repeated purchase for this bra top cause it’s really comfortable. And the support is just fine for hiit and running. 5 stars. 
Received after almost 3 weeks. Material looks good and nice.
Got all the items ! Delivery was fast ! Super love the material too! 
"fits well! good quality, looks like the picture, and is a nice material ̈ "
"Item is nice, and worth the price paid. Like that it’s longer line so no issue wearing it on its own. Am a regular UK8. Size M feels a bit tight, would size up to L on my next purchase "
Amazing quality! Second time I order this bra ... I now have 3 colors 
"For A75 and 64kg, Seller recommended size S-M but I went with M and it fits nicely. Items came in 6 days. I’m very satisfied with the purchase. "
"Super love this sports bra! Got it in both black and wine red. I’m 157cm, 45kg, 25inch waist - Size M fits me perfectly.  "
Took the advice of the person from the Moving Peach chat to take an M size. It fits well. My typical bra size is 75B. I like the colour and soft fabric.
Long wait but very happy with the purchase. Fits UK 8 like a glove! 
Delivery came earlier than the expected day. Material is of good quality given this price point. Hope the padding won’t move ard when doing workouts. Recommended ! 
Design and quality is good and it's very comfortable! Loving the wine red colour piece especially! 
Read comments to size up and it was a good fit! Material is nice and probably can last for a few months of wear. 
Exactly the same as the photo.  It is really very comfortable and secure. Can wear this and do intense exercise. 
Good thing I sized up to M. Usually I'm an S for sports bra. Material is good and fits really well. Will buy again
Amazing quality. The padding for the white one is different from the green - it’s more push up! It fits great.
"quality seems good, comfortable, nicely packaged"
"Took awhile to arrive , quality is rather decent "
Rlly good quality. Usually an S but read reviews and sized up. Fits perfectly. Love the in built bra. The white color is rlly vibrant and looks rlly good. 
"I’m B70 , this M size fixed with me. very comfortable. I will purchase other colours."
Size fits well
Good quality. 1.59cm and 48kg. Medium fits well. 
Item took very Long to reach me and also quality for one is ok but another is soso only as different manufacture
Amazing quality Love the criss-cross detail on the back  Can't wait to try!  
"Good fit and support, would love if there was a bit more coverage around the armpit area, and slightly thicker straps "
Great quality! Must take bigger than your usual size.  I have tiny boob but still had to take L size
Not super tight but it is very pretty. There is minimal padding and they are removable 
Material seems good for the price!  Size fits well too will purchase again! 
The top is good quality. Will re purchase again if have sales.
Value for money! 
"really satisfied with the purchase! got a size M, perfect fit (for reference i’m 75B)"
"I really love the material of the sports bra! For its price, the quality is very good! I am a usual S, however heard the sizing runs smaller so got a M which fits perfectly! Love the colour as well, highly recommended! "
Third purchase!
2nd purchase. As usual it’s comfortable to wear and the red is so nice. Good attire comes with great pricing. 
Delivery is good :)
"Ordered on 7/7, delivered on 16/7. Material is very good for the price and comfortable. I like it. "
Good   
"Very happy with the purchase. Quality is good, material is good."
"Fast and efficient seller! Leggings are super soft and fit of the top is great! Thank you for the items, love them! "
Fast delivery with well bubble wrapped! Didnt expect it to be such comfy and good quality! Color is darker than the photo itself and it’s really a pretty piece :) satisfied with my purchase! highly recommended!
"Bought on 18 June arrived on 30 June, took awhile but the material is very worth for the price I paid for! Color is true too. My first buy and will definitely get again :) I am 34B, 15.5"" ptp and I got size M fits me well not tight. Seller recommended me M and I'm glad I went with her advice. "
"Loved the colour of the bra! Size L fits me well, I normally wear a 36B bra. Will definitely purchase again if there is an offer"
"Really comfortable and great fit. Normally a 75D, have not tried it for exercising but should be okay for low impact workouts."
 Re-purchased this during GSS. Am disappointed that the material is thinner and very different.  The cutting is smaller which makes it unflattering. The straps is thinner too. Wine red was bought 2 months ago and the black is new.
Quality good!
Received in good condition but cutting is small
Fast delivery! Good for it's price and well recommended!!! 
"Good fit and decent support and quality  As suggested in other reviews, better to size up from the size chart given"
cute top but may need to size up as the cutting is small. usually a XS and even S is a little tight and short for me. 
long delivery but very satisfied with my purchase! 75C and fits well!
Received in good condition. Delivery took awhile to arrives. Material likewise is good and price is reasonable. I am standing 165cm and weight approx 60kg so sizing just nice.
Delivery is quite long but items are received well
"Love the material and design! Fast delivery and well packaged! It’s a bit tight for me in terms of putting it on and getting it off, should have sized up but nevertheless, love it! "
LOVE IT! Really damn pretty and of good quality!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Fits well and material is good however the sizing runs abit small. Bought L but tight, feels like M."
Quality is thick and good but it has no support at all has has the tendency to make the boobs feel like a uniboob somehow when scooped together
Excellent quality would definitely purchase again in other colors!! Love it
Received item in good condition. Nice colour and packing. Thanks seller. 
Overall ok! 
item received is as of picture shown. v comfy material but i have choose a S size which feels abit tight for me. will purchase size m next. 
"Quality is good. I’m 1.62 54kg, L size fits nicely."
Received in good condition. Fit like a glove. I'm a usual Nike M. Will repurchase other colors. 
Second buy and i like the color. Material is thick and fits well. Happy with the overall purchase 
Bought 2 previously and bought another 2 more in different colours! Comfy and definitely worth the price 
Quality is really good for the price and material is extremely smooth and stretchy 
"M is good for UK8, bra size 32C. Colour is nice and material is comfortable. Good. "
"Received in good condition, nice material, recommend upsize at least 1-2 sizes"
"2nd purchase with moving peach! Super happy with the quality as usual :) normally S and wears 75C, M fits well for medium impact"
Was told that item was stolen at logistic and amount was refunded to me.
"Items received in about a week. Colours are true to second photo, very nice! I'm a UK8, 75B and 16.5"" ptp, size M fits just nice for me and reaches my waist. Cutting for red is slightly smaller than green, green feels more stretchy. Material is very comfy! "
Package came very fast. Like the quality and also the good price value of the seller! Will continue supporting!  Cheers 
Item came nicely packed. Shipping a bit slow but for the price the quality was quite impressive. Can’t say it’s the softest cos lululemon is still softer but not bad already. 
Lovely product as always!!!!! 
Got a white piece and the material is good! The design is true to picture and I am very satisfied with this purchase. Definitely will repurchase again in future! Stretchy and comfortable to wear as an active wear and can also be worn out as a top if you like! 
So so happy with the purchase! Been looking for affordable and good quality sports bras for the longest time and this is truly the best out there. Beautiful design and fantastic quality!
"Well received! I was hoping the green on both top and bottom would be identical, unfortunately material and color is different. Nonetheless overall good buy! "
sized down as per the reviews said and it fits perfectly and comfortably for vigorous activity!! 
"Beautiful design. Material is soft. Placed order on 18 jun, items was shipped out by seller the next day. Good service.  "
Good quantity .fast delivery. Thank you seller 
Great material and very fitting! I like this brand. Thanks Shopee
Pretty
Quality is great given the price paid. Highly recommend.
Good purchase during timesale ....... Thanks good material 
L size fits me nicely
material is amazingggg especially for the price delivery took a while but v cheap and good
Delivery a bit slow. But products and quality pretty good for the price
Packing and the quality is good but the new clothing smell was stronge. 
Order came earlier than expected. Delivery took only one week. Bought the green colour previously. Fits nicely and i love it!
Seller suggested S size for me for I chose M size base on other buyer review and I’m Glad I did. Fits well. No fats bulging out 
First time purchased from Moving Peach. The delivery took about 6 working days. I get my usual size and it fits me well. I like the colour. Highly recommended. :) 
Material is soft and comfortable. Looking forward to try on ! 
Well received and good quality! Do buy 1 size up from your original sizing. Not all are moving peach brand. 
"Pls get this top, the cutting is chic, goes well w practically any bottoms. Just placed my order for another colour."
Fits nicely
"love the item, good quality."
"Im a 34C, able to fit. Nice comfy exercise sports bra for easy movement. Will buy other colours soon! "
Received in good order. Quality feels good and soft.. hopefully fits my size after I give birth! 
Really satisfied with the quality and the price paid! Will order again!!
"First purchase from moving peach. The cut fits me nicely, am a size S. Delivery a little long but still ok. Colour looks more maroon in real life, camera couldn't capture actual colour. "
Got the right size as recommended by the seller. Thinking of getting myself another one 
"Take note that not all moving peach items are self manufactured. Bought 5 items and only 2 was self manufactured with its own branding and packaging. This is not self manufactured, but size L fits a uk6-uk8, 75B, i sized up as per reviews and it does fit me well. Quality is great too."
"Second time purchasing this top! Cutting is small, recommend to size up"
Well recd Many time purchase Like the products Thank you seller
i bought a moving peach sport bras and of all this fits the best.
I’m a UK6. I followed the reviews and size up which I’m glad I did. Size M fits just nice for me any tighter and I won’t be able to fit. 
"Absolutely amazing! My first purchase from moving peach and the quality is really good, sizing is good, but the delivery speed is a little slow. Not a problem. The seller recommended S but I went for M, luckily and it's a perfect fit! Will definitely buy more even without flash sales"
Delivery faster then expected. Items are very pretty and material feels nice. 
Comfortable and hold well 
My second purchase of this item and delivery is still fast. 
Color look good but long delivery
arrived in great condition. im a lululemon size 4 in bras. stuck to size S and fits me well. did purchase an M before but it was too loose hence the support was poor. stick to your true size. thanks!!
The delivery took awhile approx 10days. But i love the smooth fabric for the legging pants. 
"Fast delivery, color is nice , also the material, very happy with this product. "
Very good buy
surprisingly good quality for its price and very stretchy yet firm!! yet to try but can’t wait
Order received! The material is Super comfortable and really looks good !
exact to pic! i’m a b75 and find M a bit tight. recommend y’all to size up! 
Repeat purchase from this seller! Will order again in future!!
"Loving the materials. With its price, the quality is damn good. Im usually size S but after reading the reviews decided to size up to M. "
I like this style compared to the rest and the tag is really from moving peach as compared to the rest where the tag is of other brand. 
"I’m so satisfied with the Quality and colour. Really Worth buying . I’m 75B, 56 kg and M fits me perfectly. Will buy again . "
Really pretty but might have consider buying one size smaller for more vigorous activity like running. A normal workout seems okay! It feels just nice on me right now and can even wear out as crop top. The material is very nice too. I am 160/60kg with A-B cup for your reference. 
Good quality!!! Would buy again only thing is shipping takes a while ):
"Indeed sweet colour. Got L size and it fits. However, not too suited for medium intensity workout as the bottom of this top keep sliding up a little."
item came exact to the pictures that were shown in the post!!
good quality. i like it. ordered white previously and purple this time. size 6 lulu = L. may show quite abit of armpit fat due to the cutting. the colour is the same as in photos. will get light purple next! 
"Read the reviews and decided to size up, glad I did so. Usually a size m for other sport bras. Love the length of it. Only thing is I realised that there's no specifc branding anywhere on the packaging. But no complains for this price point!  "
"Delivery took only a week! Color was true to picture. Good material! Worth the price, will purchase again :)"
"Great workout top for Low/medium intensity workouts! Looks gorgeous as well can be worn for hiking/any outdoor activities. I’m 162cm, 53kg and it reaches to my waist, good coverage. Size M fits me just nice too!"
I was surprised by the quality of tight and sport bra. The tight is super comfy and stretchable while doing yoga. The sport bra design is so nice and support was good! 
Delivery took 10 days which i consider fast. Sizing wise is just nice for me as i usually wear size S but worried it might be too tight and M turns out just fine for me. Material is great. Overall i am very happy with the purchase and will likely to purchase more. 
Repeated buyer! Superb quality and very pretty shade of lilac grey :)
"Good quality, but the armpit area is a tad unflattering as it shows a bulge when i wear it at times. However, it is of a good size for me and quite fitting, im 164cm 53kg for reference"
Very Good fit. Love the material. Delivery was fast. Thought will be a bit delayed. Thank you seller! 
"The top was quite comfortable, sizing runs quite small. Recommended to size up, which i did but its still slightly tight but not uncomfortable! "
"I wear an Adidas size S / 34A and M fits perfectly - snug but does not suffocate you. Material is thick, smooth and comfortable, but is more cotton-y than regular sports bras, so it does not wick sweat very well. The bra gives medium support - works well for HIIT, but idk how it'll hold in the wash!"
"Delivery was a bit slow but probably due to COVID. Item received as per image and description. I’m a UK8 and got size L, it was comfortable with allowance. Material is soft and smooth! "
"Good quality for price, but it is very tight for 80C, so take note of that. It feels quite secure because it is so tight but I feel like my chest is quite constrained. It is a bit hard to put on because it is so tight but fits okay. "
"Pleasantly surprise with the quality. Have not worn it to a workout but have tried it on. Just as previous reviews had mentioned, size up and it fits just nicely. Definitely a good buy with the discounted rate. "
"Very pretty piece! Love the red wine colour. I'm really petite (below 150) so bought it after reading reviews about the size. Definitely smaller than typical sizing so fits me perfectly. Seller sent out the day after purchase but considering it's from China, delivery took over a week to my mailbox. "
"The material is thick and feels very nice. The colour is also very pretty and it has a flattering cut. I sized-up because of the reviews and it fits me very well. The quality is really good for the price, I’m impressed. Will definitely buy again in the future!!"
"Size a bit small, material looks like it’ll fur/ ball up. Design is super pretty, snug fit. Overall could’ve added a bit more stretch but I still like it. Absolutely beautiful design."
This has to be my fav sports bra from moving peach! Super comfortable and the material feels nice! Must buy!!
Bought this on 1st June and it took 15 days to deliver it so it is still acceptable during this period. I’m an usual size M person. My measurement is 75B and ptp is 16.5”. So size M will be just nice and fitting for me. Do not size up if you are an usual size M. It’s so comfy and will buy again.
"White colour is moving peach brand while purple shoes another brand, maybe it’s their sister brand?"
"Delivery took 9days, cropped sportsbra fits 30b for size S. Love the back details, price is worth for the material. Will definitely buy again! Hopefully there will be pretty pastel colours (: "
"My second purchase for this sports bra and it fits like a glove! The green turned out to be slightly bluish green but a pretty unique colour that I wouldn’t mind trying out. Love the material, it’s so smooth and buttery! Pretty supportive as well. Worth getting during flash sales :)"
I'm UK 8 but bought size L after reading the review. I think it fits just nice/a lil loose. I recommend to upsize so it's easier to take off. 
"ordered on 8th, seller shipped out the next day and received on 19 june. thanks seller! countless of buys from this seller"
Repeat purchase! I first bought one to try it out and I loved how secure and comfortable it was on me so I bought other colours this time. I’m a 34b and size L fits me very well. 
"Lilac grey is really pretty! Love the fit, usual size S but size up & fit comfortably! Received within 2 weeks"
I am 158cm. 51kg. Ordered M size. Jus nice now. Hope it will not loosen after many washes. I think i can take s too. But do note that the straps will squeeze our fleshy's back if too tight 
"Very nice and flattering cut, would recommend. But maybe for mid-low impact workouts. "
True to picture. Love it. Fast delivery. Colour is more red than wine. 
"Bought four colours of this bra, good quality and good price during flash sale"
"Green is more of turquoise I fee ( but I love it !!)   Bought it during flash sale , a nice purchase"
"Very comfortable fit and cutting! Will buy other designs. Am a normal size M, upsized to L after reading comments. Though L fits comfortably, felt like my true size will be more suitable for high intensity sports and ptp feels abit loose when moving arms."
Abit tight but love the material so so much. 
Sexy back! And also pretty good quality! Overall happy with what I bought~
"Love the pieces! I am a 75B, 159cm and 48kg. M size fits very well. The length is nice too. Not too revealing. The purple is a very nice colour. If the delivery doesn’t take so Long, it would entice me to purchase again. The material is soft and comfortable. Definitely worth the money. "
Items received in good condition. Delivery took some time but was pretty decent wait. 
Lovely! This is my third purchase of the same item already- affordable sportswear! 
Good quality material.Like the design. May get another colour of a smaller size.
Super love the back design. Recommend to take one size bigger. 
"UK 10 , 75C bra size, fits perfectly. Good support even when sprinting. Material very good and comfortable. "
Not bad quality. Material is soft and smooth. Comfortable. Good for workouts. Would prefer the length to be slightly longer tho.
Bought white in size M and grey in size S after reading the reviews. White is indeed smaller in size for some reason. Great quality! 
"Usually wear size S for sports bra, size up to L after I read the comments. The sports bra is not for push up. "
"Really soft material. Read other reviews and sized up. Not intended to be used for high intensity workouts but tried these for a run and it was still ok!! Comfortable and even after washing, it retains its stretch. Thanks!!"
Second purchase. Item received in good condition. LIKE 
Heed reviewers’ advice to size up and it’s really so when I tried it on.
"Wearing it for zumba and yoga, very good Lucky that i sized up and it fits nicely,not too tight Will consider buy again next time Thank you"
"Bought size S before, and now trying size M. Size M fit better for B70"
This was SUPER comfortable. One of the best sports bra I’ve bought in my sports bra buying frenzy this season. 100/100 would buy again! 
"Second order & am pleasantly surprised by the speed of delivery this time! Ordered on 6/6 received on 16/6, compared to the previous time when it took almost a month. The pink one seems abit tighter than the green one I got previously tho.. or maybe I got fatter idk"
"I’m normally an XS/S for clothes, but very glad I bought L for this. Fits just nice. I’m 161cm 47kg 32C. "
3rd purchase already and it’s one of my fav sports bra to date! Really affordable with decent quality. Colours are all pretty too! Sizing and padding can be a little inconsistent but it’s alright. 
"Super good quality and fit me well! I’m really impressed, will definitely buy more stuff from this seller!!!! "
Sizing runs small please size up for purchase! 
"Good quality for the price, although I noticed that one bra is smaller when they are both The same size.  So one fits perfectly the other is loose."
"Item received as per the modelled picture. Quality feels good, and it’s my second purchase from this site. I sized up from my previous MP order for a looser fit for this item, but my usual size would have been fine too."
"Pleased with this purchase. Haven’t tried working out in it yet so can’t provide accurate comments about the quality, but after just trying it on, feels comfy and worth it for the price point. "
My second time purchased from this seller!  But the green color quiet smaller in size than the Lilac.. But still fits me fine. Thank you! 
"extremely comfortable, wore and used them the day they arrived!! fits rather well, except that the straps on the back can be a little loose at times. Overall still love the back design, thank you very much! "
Well received. Good quality. I’m uk8 34B and M size fits perfectly
bought during flash sale so worth it! Cutting is really nice and color abit more to the Teal side! 
"Stretchable and fits well! Very comfortable material, must buy"
"Product came! Material is indeed very soft, just hoping that the bra would have more support. "
very fitting and flattering. good to get one size bigger than usual. 
"Bought this during the flash sale and it received it within two weeks!! Material is really good!! I am usually a uk 8, size M, but decided to size up following the other reviews and I’m really glad I did. Would highly recommend buying a size up or it might be difficult to take out the top."
Item as shown in the pictures and as expected! Thank you seller! Can’t wait to try them out! Feels very comfortable!
Repeated purchase! This time ordered a size up for a more comfort wear.
"Great quality, love the back details. Super pretty piece!!"
Gifted these to one of my girlfriends for her birthday and she loves em!

"Value for money, love the colour :) will be buying more! "

Fast handling and delivery. Order received in 7 days from order.   Item quality is nice and seller is responsive and accommodating. Would love to buy again but unfortunately there's another seller here with lower price. 
Bought size M and L cuz not sure what size I was. Quite pleased with it.
Repeat purchase and pretty fast delivery. Material is soft and comfy. Adidas pants is shorter and smaller than UA though both M size.
my 2nd time purchasing! looks great. however initially there were some delivery issue from shopee. i haven’t receive this items and the app stated successfully delivered. always check the status!! 
Happy with product !! Very cheap deal will buy again !!!! May need to work on delivery as it can be quite slow sometimes
"Fast delivery and good quality for its price.   Bought Size L - Fit just right for waist 31inches, length is slightly above kneecap (Height: 173cm)  Nobody should be complaining about it, if you are fussy then go spend a min. of $30 on an original pair instead.   Overall, highly recommended. "
"size just nice and super worth it, value for money, marerial is soft and comfortable too"
Second purchase. This time buy Addidas and Nike. Fast delivery. Recommend to soak in detergent water before wearing as the black dye will come off. However after that everything is fine. 
Items received as described. 2nd time purchased. Great products. Thank you. 
Material seem to be good.  Good and highly recommend. Thank you 
looks ok feels ok will buy again if needed..............thanks
Thanks for the great item and service! Much appreciated :)))
this is my second time ordering n delivery came faster than the first! material is always soft and comfortable for the price! happy with my purchase 
"Material is nice and comfortable to wear, but the cutting is slightly smaller than expected. Design was rly nice and as described "
 Love this sports bra. Got M based on review and fit is perfect. Material is thick.What I don't like is the thick bra padding but it can be change so I'm good. 
Happy with my purchase. I’m a size XS for cotton on body yoga bras and this size S fits perfectly!
Really good - this is def my favourite top from moving peach. Think the purple is better quality than the black somehow.
Received in good condition. Thank you  
"super comfortable, second buy, it is true to size for me"
"Order on 07 Jul revved on 15 Jul from CN to Sg, fast delivery, suggest to order 2 size bigger and should fit well. thanks seller."
Fast delivery . Good items. 
"Good quality , good for the price  Will buy again It does look authentic "
Descent quality for the price though length is a bit short. Second buy
Delivery is fast. Material is not very thick but ok for the price . Do order 2 size up .I followed based on guide and it came smaller than stated. Luckily can fit my girl 
"Size need to up 2 to 3 up. If you are XL, need to buy at least 2XL or 3XL. If you are M, at least L or XL.  Quality of the material is thin and soft within my expectation. Comfortable to wear to play sports and sleep.   But my yellow band only receive one when I order two different sets. But nvm."
"Item received within a week plus. Size ok, Adidas logo one smaller in size. Colors run need to wash with dark clothes. Slightly thin material - light can pass thru but when worn not transparent. Overall good buy after using shopee coins."
Delivery was pretty fast and the shorts are comfortable. Be sure to get 2 sizes larger than what you usually wear. 
Good buy for the price! Material slightly thin but is cooling for causal wear or home outfit! Recommended one size larger than your usual size! 
"the pants smelled abit weird but guess thats just the factory smell, thanks for the wristband anyway!"
Order on 16 July and received the item on 21 July. Quality ok
Package received finally.. ordered 4 this time a pair of nike and adidas. Will buy more again in the future
"Shorts were received way faster than the rest of the items ordered on the same day despite choosing normal postage. Shorts as advertised, light and breathable material. Have to choose 1-2 sizes for comfort. Waist 31 opted for L "
"material is good! delivery took quite fast too! overall, good product, although XL is still small for me :-)"
Received items material very soft  thanks
Fast delivery good quality will buy again 
Excellent pants quality and design Breathable and possible for running or any other sports activities. Highly recommended would deal again! 
"Items received in good condition, my second time buying from this seller will buy again if have other design. "
Happy about product! I will definitely buy it again :)) just that need to work on delivery as can be pretty slow sometimes but apart from that is good
Second purchase.. cheap and good!! 
Items received in good conditions. Love the material. Thank you seller 
"Delivery was super fast! Arrived in less than a week. Quality is actually really good- not the thin cheap material kind. Very sturdy and high quality AF for the price! Seller even included a free Nike rubber wrist band, thank you!! Will definitely buy again. :) "
good quality pants

"Fast delivery considering shipping from China. Material is acceptable, though slightly thin; still, good for home use . As many pointed out, the waist is small though. Bought 2 sizes up but still tight. It was meant for elder kid...so now probably goes to the younger one. Thks for the wrist band!"

Second purchase bot as a gift for Frend. Great massage quality highly recommend 
"Received today, considered fast delivery as I placed order few days ago only. Disappointed that the box received seems to be either  badly crashed / used / display set. It was so crumpled, doesn't looks new to me at all. Found few oily fingerprints on the machines. Thus a 3stars rating. "
Solid buy. Fast delivery. Tried it damn relaxing helps to loosen tight muscles.  highly recommended! 
Ordered Wed got it Fri. Box was slightly dented most likely by delivery agent but item is intact and ok. Tried and it works very well. Very powerful even at 1st speed. I have plantar fasciitis and pain is very bad but after using yesterday and today pain has reduced a lot. Highly recommended. 
"#shopeehaul fast delivery. Cheapest massage gun in Shopee. Item is heavy. Battery can last for about 1 hour continuous usage, after full charge."
"Cheap but risky purchase, very heavy device. The item came faulty, and worst is the extremely slow replies from customer service. Had to message a few times each time before I get a patronising reply. CS is going to send me a new charger but via normal mail, hopefully it solves the problem."
"Item received really fast, well packed and good to use , although can not compare with terra gun but for this price it’s really worth it"
"Item received very fast and efficient packed nicely and looks good, material is good as described, will buy more next time"
"Ordered on 7th, received on 9th. The vibration is kinda strong, so I suppose it’s good. Especially to release muscle tension and stuff"
"the massage gun took slightly longer for delivery. overall, it is in good working condition."
"Super quick delivery, second purchase. Great for back and neck massage."
Very fast and smooth delivery. Packaging is good Plus easy to use and fast charging.  
Delivery was fast and item was all in place value will purchase again 
Arrive less than a week... Vibration is awesome for this price... Tried and works very well... It would be better if there was a selector for different modes as currently u have to go through 6 modes b4 u can turn it off.. Other den that the ball head discolours easily after single use
Fast delivery... Smooth transaction and powerful massage gun. 
Its quite powerful and can last about 30mins before it starts to weaken 
Awesome seller with great product range and super fast shipping!!!!
"Very Fast received, Delivery took only 3day by j&t express, tested working but only six speed, so must use max speed then got the impact, for the price is consider good. "
Quick delivery! Haven’t really tried it but turn it on to have a test and looks to be working well. The massage gun is slightly heavy which seems really solid quality.
Order received. Thank you seller. Have yet to try but overall good feedback. 
"Received product really fast, tried it on aching muscles and really work wonders. "
"Delivery came within a few days, can’t wait to try it out! Reasonable price. "
Super fast delivery. Less than 2 days upon ordering. Quite strong. Thanks seller.
Value for money. Powerful tool. Sturdy material
Order well received! Delivery was fast! 
Good condition. Fast delivery! Good deal & its my second time purchase
"Worst Buy! No business ettique. Faulty product, plug exploded which nearly caused fire. Insisted buyer to exchange and no apologies. Bully buyer by insisting her to go down to shop to return product, if not, no refund when the refund has aldy been accepted. Worst experience ever! Never buy from them"
"Item received within 2 working days. Bought it for my wife. It is heavy, but that's not an issue for us. The item is still working after testing it for 3 to 4 days. Encountered once or twice sudden auto stop while using though. Acceptable minor glitch, as long as it serves its purpose. "
"Fast delivery, item received within two days. Massage gun works well. Consider to buy one more set for my BFF."
"This is the 4th, 5th & 6th ones I'm buying, this time for 3 of my colleagues! Been recommending this product to people I know! Good things must be shared, ya!"
Good I bought it again because it’s actually very decent!!! I love it for the price too!!! Can’t wait to give it as a present

The 7th one I'm buying. This time is also for a colleague that i recommend the product.

"Very fast delivery, delivered within 2 days, recommended. "
Item received in about a week after order. Properly packed. Product a bit on the heavy side but working well. Can use for about half an hour after it’s fully charged. 
Worth the price of $25. This design only have 1 button to switch On/Off and adjust the speed up to 6x.  Its very basic as compared to other brands I had bought.
"Delivery was fast. Item works fine too. You need to use a bit of force when inserting the heads if not it'll drop out. Testing to see how long it'll last before I purchase a 2nd one. For now, this works! "
Received items with thanks

Interesting product . Fast delivery . Felt my posture straighten after a day of use. But pls don't tighten it too tight. Acts as a reminder not to slouch

very easy to use and delivery was fast. Item looked exactly what is posted here.
Item received as per stated by seller! Recommended seller!
Followed instructions but feels weird. Doesn't seem to support or change much. 
Quality ok but size too small.
"Item received as described. Sturdy material. Good quality. Only thing is that you should wear a shirt underneath it to be comfortable, as the straps will rub against the skin otherwise. "
Quite stable. Would be even better if it's full back as currently it only supports your upper back. 
Clear guideline on how to use 
Very good. Adjustable strap. Worth the money and value for money.
Good and fast... Tape is not bad but I doubt it's 3M... However it does what it does... But not as strong as the real deal...   Other that that everything. Is all good ..
It helps make it easier to straighten ur back if u straighten it first. But it doesn't stop u from hunch backing. 
Used it and feels good! Good reminder for posture
"Item received in good condition. Not very uncomfortable, just that am not sure how it’s going to keep my posture right since I’m still able to bend like normal"

"Not bad, able to feel relieve and improvement quite quickly."
"Cheap and good. Helps me in straightening my back, but would still suggest to go see a specialist if you really have serious back issue. This is not a substitute!"

"Value for money, recommended."
"Quick delivery and product of good quality. Fits well and helps to keep my back straight. While the brace is very good, still need to strengthen core muscles to prevent neck and shoulder aches."
Comfortable and product is as described. Helps to widen the shoulder as well.
The delivery is fast and accurate. But the product does not really work. It does not straighten the back at all. I can still slouch after putting it on. Not a good product to use.
received item. still unsure of how it works. hopefully it can help in straightening the back posture
Received in great condition. Came in a ziplock bag and a info sheet on how to use. Good quality. Not sure how good it works. The strap can be a bit long for those who are smaller in size 
The item is better than I expected. It is so useful and helpful to everyday posture. Seller is prompt in replying and is fast in transaction. 
"delivery timing is alright, packaging and product is great"
Delivery time was fine. Items are in order. Didn’t know there was size. All came large size. Have not tried. Quality seemed good. 
The product is quite nice. Material quite good. But the belt kept shifting out of position making it less effective. 
"Quality ok. Size is correct. But there is no elasticity in the harness at all, so it is not possible to shift one’s shoulders forward, hence can be slight uncomfortable.   I bought a different design from Don Quixote in Japan that was elastic at the back and the straps. Much more comfortable. "
Item well received and fast delivery 
Good quality product and fast delivery. Love the item. Will definately purchase more from seller in future! Thanks for the fast delivery!

Quality is pretty good and it does help to pull back your shoulders

As usual. Items received as shown. Fast delivery.
Wow Quality is soft and superb!!  Love it!!!!!!!! !!!!!
"Brought these two pieces together, good material soft & lightweight.  Both are light & clean in colours.  Delivered doorstep within 10 days."
"Nice purple colour.  This is my 2nd purchase as I love the cutting very much & material is soft, do not have to iron, dry fit material."
"The back design is very flattering and material is good quick dry material, very good sewing quality as well. Only thing is that the purple seems a little too dull for me. Timely delivery and well packaged."
Material is good and very breathable. This is my 3rd purchase from moving peach and I love it. It is comfortable and looks good on me. Highly recommended......................
Bought the smallest size but still found it big but good that you can actually tie the 2 ends at the back together so that it becomes a crop top. Would recommend the black one as the light  colored one would be prone to obvious swear marks 
"Second time buying in a different colour. Comfortable material. Arm holes are very big though, wish they were slightly smaller"
"Bought e top to try, looks good, hope is comfortable too. Thanks."
"Soft, airy and comfy. Love the opening at the back which can be tied up into a cute ribbon. "
Very cute sportswear. Material's a bit thin though so white may be see through. Slightly disappointed the purple is not as obvious as the picture. S is already quite loose fitting for the average size lady. 
"Wow i love. It's soft and looks good quality, even though the material is very thin. But that's a good thing for singapore weather. Am 161cm and 53kg, bought size S for the tops & M for the bottom"
Quality is gd and cooling but prefer @daisygreen on carous*ll as that shop has nicer n more variety! 
Material is nice and soft but a little sheer. Cutting is a bit big for M size but can tie up the back to make it more fitting. Happy with the item will buy more in S size when it’s available. 
Thin good quality material!
"173cm, 66kg & size S fits good! material nice & smooth too "
The colour of this TOP is really nice(my photo can’t capture the right tone). The material is really soft and it is very light. 
Delivery take about 2 weeks. But overall good purchase! 
White color a little too stark but otherwise good fit. 
Second purchase of the same design for a friend because it’s really value for money
Comfy n nice
Once again surprised by the good quality given the cheap price
"loose fit, light weight, very comfortable. bought 7 items from this store and i honestly prefer the quality of their tank tops over all the other items."
"This cut is super flattering. Big arm holes and when paired with the moving peach tights, very slim looking "
Very cooling and comfy material. Would buy again. FYI usually a UK6 for tops
Item packed and received in good condition. The only problem is the top is pretty thin for the price. Other than that its dry fit and breathable
Very nice and comfy tank tops! The purple is so niceeeeeee. S size is just nice for me -Uk 10. Highly recommended 
Love love this tshirt. I bought tge second top in different colour. Material is cool and design is amazing. 
Black top with option to tie back. Size fits nicely. Arm hole is big for easy movement.
"Cutting is nice, but the purple looks more grey. "
material is so breezy!!
good and breathable top although the arm hole was slightly bigger than expected. order came in good condition. seller was very nice to help me with my order. will definitely recommend others to buy from them as well! 
 fast delivery. arrived in about less than a wee. love the quality. glad i remembered to size up
Light & airy top. Good buy
Very soft and cooling material. Has a flattering cut when worn. Would recommend the purchase of this item.
The material is so soft! It looks see through here because of the flash but it isn’t really that translucent. Love that i can tie it behind
Buy different colour for this design. Very comfortable. Cutting is big and enough for bust more than 100 cm. Quick dry as well :))
This is my third Repeated purchase ! Material is cooling and soft. And the cutting will makes u look slimmer . Highly recommended 
Material feels cooling and of good quality for the price! Would recommend :-) 
Items received in good packaging. Size fit well. Good quality. Happy with my  purchase. Thank you seller.
"Received today! The quality is great, can't wait to wear it in Phase 2!"
"Top material is dri fit type, gd for exercise is cooling. The sleeve hole opening for this design is quite big intentionally but overall nice design and material. "
Bought cos of raving reviews of this piece. Reasonable delivery time via normal mail. I like it alot.
In love w this piece! Its very airy and comfortable and its a cute piece too
Delivery within 2 weeks. Good quality & very comfortable. Will recommend! 
Their quality is good. Great for the humid weather and low impact exercise.
Item came nicely packed! Love the material of this!! Super relax loook and slightly big around the armpit area. 
"Green yoga top fits well (I'm 1.67m, 53kg, uk size 4-6) but the cut is not the most flattering. Black top fits well with a flattering cut. "
Good quality! Thanks! 
"Order received in good condition, love the material, will def buy it again "
"cute little ribbon behind, fits well too"
Love the quality of the top. I am a M but took one size down S and it fits nicely. Will buy again.
Third purchase from this shop. Always delighted with its prompt delivery. Quality is worth the price!  Thank you!!! 
Received in good condition. I already have the white one and i love the design so much that i get one in black as well. 
I'm usually a size m n s fits me just right! Very nice
Overall a great buy. The material is good and airy. Would definitely recommend.
Item received in good condition! Love the quality! 
Very soft and comfortable. But no flattering and also it rolls down as u exercise  
"Quality not bad for the price paid. Will recommend taking your usual size for this top, but for their sports bra, better to size up. Probably will wait for flash sales to buy more of their items. "
Fast delivery. Product quality is also good. I Will buy again. 
Delivery took quite long but the material is soft and comfortable
"Material is good but wait is long. Worth it though, buying again."
second purchase!
came with a hole
"First time buying fr this seller. Delivery took a while but understandable during this CB time. Each clothes was sealed in a plastic bag. Love all of the design, material is cooling, perfect for Spore weather. All are loose cutting except the grey top is more fitted to the  body. Thank u seller!"
Ordered the same design in a different colour. Love this top!
"Stretchy and smooth material. Looks a bit big at first but I really like the fit after wearing it :) esp when tied up. For reference I'm 151cm. The armholes are extremely big tho, I'm wearing a sports bra here. Received in 10days :) "
"Got the yoga blanket and the top. But the packaging is slightly off. In totality, it's fine to use. Delivery is pretty fast too"
Item is as seen in pictures. The material is quite good and very cooling.
"Good quality fabric, will purchase again. Thanks!"
Typically UK 8-10 and the size was perfect! Armholes were big ofc but not baggy. Material also feels light!
"Item well received. Good quality. Right size.  For compress tight pants, good to buy 1 size bigger."
Comfortable and cooling! Saw comments to size down so got S instead of my usual M which was a good fit.
Good material. Pretty cut. 
quality is alright as compared to other products :))))))))
"Material is very soft and smooth. But if u not ok with it being see-through, better not to get white colour."
S fits perfectly. Comfy material to run in as well 
Nice material n soft. Cutting good. Received in well padded envelope 
Item arrived in mailbox as ordered. Feels right looks right.
"Comfortable and airy, quality seems quite good. Size S seems to fit well (UK8)"
"Super comfortable. Quality is great, material is breathable. Overall a good purchase."
Item looks shorter than in picture. Haven’t try but material feels good.
"Love the back detail , able to tie It up and great lightweight material :)  Size is good for 153cm, petite fellow girls! "
The white is very white but I love the material and cutting! Flattering and extremely comfortable. Very cooling to exercise in. Might buy again. 
"I’m 1.64m and size S/M usually. S fit perfectly, though the arm holes are cut large. Material seems more suitable for going out than exercising as it feels very luxe. "
"166cm, 56kg- usually wear S/M for tops, but read the reviews which recommended sizing down. Glad I heeded the advice and selected S size cuz it’s just right. "
Good material but sizing run small so those who are L sized should reconsider when getting. 
Airy fabric! Wondering if there will be any restock for the white in size S? Good buy!
"Material is super soft, lightweight and comfy!"
Love it cos of the chic design :)  
good material for workouts bc its v light and feels quite delicate as well. will definitely buy more in the future.
Like it very much .Thanks seller.
First-time purchase and I must say I'm blown away by the quality. Will definitely repurchase in the future!  
"Item received well packaged. Though it took a Long time to arrive due to the current situation, i have no complains as the item is delivered as described. "

"Good quality and fit, cutting is nice. Worth the money overall! "

Bought the white m but a bit big for me. I am a uk 8-10. Size s will prob b better. Nice material
Good deal! Will purchase it again! Highly recommended.
Light comfy material.  
"Material is thin but nice and soft, also very cooling. I’m an XS and find the armholes slightly too big, but it’s great for a baggy fit. Received this in my letter box, delivery took 3 weeks which was longer than I expected. Would recommended this top! "
Second purchase. Material is light and soft. Cooling for wearing while WFH in this humid weather. Good buy during sales.
Great quality! Thin and cooling to wear for workouts! Happy with my purchase will buy more in future ! Motivation to exercise !
Item received in good condition. Tried them on and they fit perfectly! Good material as well.

Delivery took exactly 2 weeks! Happy buyer 
"Item came nicely packed, material feels smooth and comfortable and cooling. Thanks!"
Take quite some time in delivery. Good quality material with the price paid. Like the design. Will order again.
"Size S for all items. Usual size S across many sports brands, and sportsbra holds up really well. Delivery took approximately 2 weeks as stated"
"Nice colour, very comfortable, I bought S and the armholes are a bit big."
"Impressive material for the price, hope it gets restocked in more colours "
Loving the items! 
Material of the tank top is so good!! Comfortably loose fitting 
"Pretty ok for the price. Like the design, but not really the material. Stretchy and thin material. "
"Item came much faster than my previous order, under 2 weeks. M fits a UK 8-10. Material feels very smooth and silky, and feels like it could double as both exercise and casual wear. Cutting is very flattering, and doesn't bunch up at the hips which can happen with some tops.  "
Materials was soft and smooth 
Order received in good condition via normal mail. Cooling material.
Love the tank tops! Affordable and comfortable. Recommended to size down as arm hole is big. 
Delivery took slightly longer but understandable due to covid. Items were individually packed and of good quality. Will repurchase if it's good while working out.
Delivery took a while but quality of items are pretty good!! Size M fits me well UK8
Shipping took a while but item is correct. The top is very light and comfortable. Good for sg weather and workout. 
Very light and smooth material! 
Good quality activewear. Love the smooth texture of pants!
"Material is soft and lightweight, great for exercise! Size S fits perfect for UK6-8."
Repeat purchase for a family member  
Soft and comfortable! Would consider getting another sports top from this shop. 
Material is light and breathable. Pit opening is abit big but okay since going with sports bra. Recommend to buy one size smaller 
"Im 58kg, 160cm. Suits me perfectly!! True to size! Highly recommended"
"Versatile and flattering design that is cute, both when the knot is tied and not. Glad I took the forum's advice to size down. A nice touch of sheer to jazz up the workout gear. Value for money. Will support this seller again."
Second time buying this top! I love it and easy to wear :) the white isn’t very translucent also
cooling and comfy material! 
Super good quality and comfy 
Repeat purchase ! Love the material. It's very comfortable:)
2.5 weeks to be delivered. Love the material 
Material is light and thin. Quality is quite good. It’s a bit loose.
very comfortable and flowy pair. definitely airy cos of the mesh. love the design!
Most average item out of my entire purchase. Quality is not as good as the leggings or sports bras
Super comfortable top with nice material that can be used for exercise 
The top is really soft and breathable. Haven’t try to exercise in it but it already feel very nice to touch. And the cutting is flattering. 
Size down as this is quite a loose piece. Super airy and feels very good material! 
very thin material but i like the cutting and there is mesh at the back too
Good quality for the price! :) 
"Good quality material! Feels very thin and cooling, good for exercise"
The top fits well and material is comfortable and cooling. Great purchase!
Good material 
Material is great! Slightly loose for me if the back is not tied. But when it’s tied it’s ok! My PTP is 15” for reference and typically wears S for sports Top 
Very nice 
I love this so much!! I wished the other colours came in my size
Value for money
Love it! Material is good. 166cm weight 53kg.  First time buying will purchase again! 
Very nice colour and great quality!
It’s cheap and nice! Design can be comparable to other reputable brands. Love it!
Super comfortable and light. Feels like airism material. Good delivery time.

Material is really silky and breathable! Favourite out of my purchases. Will cart out another piece in a different colour after this. Recommend to buy. 
"        Loving my loots from moving peach! it has flattering cut, and the material is really comfortable. I’m a UK6, size XS/ S for all my sports attire. I chose size S despite reading the comments to upsize, and it fits really well! "
Comfy material
"Absolutely head over heals for this one !! Besides the tie design that i like alot , the material feels so silky, smooth , light . And plenty of space to air my armpits HAHA super worth it <3 . Just that i hope its more purple (tag actually said its grey dawn hm)"
Love the soft material and dusty purple colour:) I’m 163cm tall and usually UK size 6~8 but bought  M size for a baggier fit. Delivery took about 2 weeks..
A dri fit material and is really nice!
Versatile.. and fix well fo rmy size
Top is very comfy! Love it!
"Lovely and soft material. I'm 150cm in height and chose S - it's a little big but I love the size. The armholes are slightly large - so you can show off the bra you have! Overall, it fits me very well, super pleased with this purchase! "
Fits well and love the colour.
Absolutely love the fit and material! Super comfortable and cooling.
"M fits loosely for UK8. White looks great while purple looks duller than in the pictures. Thin, comfortable material."
bought in S size because cutting runs big and it fits perfectly!! i’m usually a uk 8-10
material is very comfortable and fits me well. Extremely flattering! happy with my purchase and will come back again 
Material very good and very comfortable. Nice colours too! 
Material is breathable and very worth for the price.
Ordered on 26 April and received on 7 May  Very worth it for the price.
Ordered on 26th April! Received on 7th May :) really good quality and fitting. Took size M 
"very soft and silky material, comfy and airy for workouts "
beautiful tank top! it’s translucent so you can playfully show your colourful sports bra :-) the material is perfect — light and absorbent!
Material is a bit thin but this is a little oversized. So it would be good to take one size smaller. 
"The top was really white, like bright white? Haha. Kinda big for size s as well. "
"purchased from movingpeach multiple times, a reliable source for affordable and nice active wear! "
"Super pleased with my purchase, even though it took quite long to receive (14 days). Quality is super good and smooth!! Will buy more! I’m a UK size 8 and bought the S size for the top."
Comfy and light Lycra-like material. Fits UK8 with a bit of allowance. Recommended!
The armhole is abit too big
"Good quality product, delivery was faster than expected!!  Seller was kind enough to allow me to change my sizing from M to S even after ordering. Thanks so much!!! "
Material is very light and comfortable. Armhole is a little big but I think it’s not much of a problem though!

True to pic and vv comfy :-) 
"Fast delivery, good quality! Will buy again"
"This piece got to be the most comfy material and the design at the back is really cute.  I love the details and definitely worth the price. Got to say that is a little sheer but definitely not too much, it can shows the cute matching sport bra a little. Love it!"
Received in good condition through mailbox. I’m uk6/8 and size S is ok. Loose at the sleeves / arm area but it’s fine vis for work out. Feels quite cooling to wear for work out. Will buy again during flash sale
The material is so soft and silky!! I love the colour and how it flows! 
"Love the material of this top so much that I have it in 3 colours. Material is soft, smooth and very cooling. Highly recommended "
looks exactly like the photo
"Shipping time was ok. White tank is a bit sheer and armpit hole is a bit big for me (I’m petite, usual size Xs uk6) but quality of fabric is pretty good!!! "
the dry fit material makes it so comfortably light and well ventilated for my workout. S fits me well - im 155cm and a usual size UK6. the back tie is cute probably more pronounced if i were to wear w my high waist tights
the material is nice and soft! delivery wasn’t too long either 
Good quality and delivery wasn’t too Long too
Thought it will be thicker / cotton material but turns out it’s fbt material and quite thin. 
    Speedy delivery Items are wrapped  Good service  Will repurchase again

Material looks good. Take quite Long to received though.. more than a week
Great material. Soft and comfy. Armpit hole is larger than usual. Please do size down for a better fit. Would purchase again but kind if pricey at 18$
"fast delivery received within 6 days, fits rly well and it’s super pretty :)) but the arm hole is abit too large even tho i got the smallest size ( i normally wear M for tops so definitely size down )  "
Item received in good condition! The material is slightly sheer in white but it is definitely breathable :) 
Very speedy purchase. Love the quality. Only downside is e slightly bigger than normal armhole for the design. Else all's great! Value for money. 
Usually a size M and I wear 34B. Got size S and it it fits just nice while still being comfortable. Suggest to size down to avoid risking arm holes being too big.
Nice and lightweight 
Order received promptly and in good condition. Second purchase
Good product.
Love the materials of the leggings 
nicely packaged and super affordable ! even though the delivery wasn’t super fast 
"Good material, really comfortable and breathable :) might get another piece. "
Well received. Great quality for the price paid. Very fitting and great for exercise. One of the best purchases! 
Items received in good condition. :) Fast delivery! 
Tops were abit big as compared to pictures shown. Material lightweight and cooling. Not bad. Quite satisfied
Material soft and nice. Great for workout. Already bought many of their sports wear from this shop! Never fails
I’m 157cm and usually a size M for tops. The too fits but it’s quite big at the arm holes. 
"Good quality! Looks exactly as advertised. I am 59kg, 1.59m tall and M fits well on me! "
Best but amongst my order. Material felt very breathable at touch. Love the color & length. 
Fits well. Delivery took 1.5 weeks due to China manpower shortage which is understandable in the current situation.
"really like the colours! super pretty! usually I get M for their bras and pants but after reading review, I decided to size down. S fits perfectly. I am 163cm."
"I love how this is little sheer, can show off the colours of the sports bra I’m wearing inside hehe! S size is definitely a comfortable size for me, 157cm, 51kg and it’s still loose! "
I'm very impressed by the quality! Exceeded by expectations for the price. The material is soft and comfortable.
"Good material, i repurchase for many times! This time order longer than usual. 2 weeks "
Second time purchasing. Size fits well and material is pretty good. Delivery took close to 2 weeks though. 
This is the sencond time ordering from seller. Fast delivery and received item in good condition! Like the item of the top as it is fast drying. Good for hot yoga classes. 
Size and material are accurate to the description. Material is durable and not thin 
really comfortable and looks exact to pic! Would highly reccomend
"I credibly comfy material and item fits well, super lightweight"
Received in 6 days! Yam colour looking top! Good material
Fast delivery looks big but should be okay.............0Z
"Loved the material, quick dry & light weight. Perfect for daily sweaty workouts. Thank you "
"Light and breezy material which I love, can’t wait to try it "
"Size fits well and material is cooling. Delivery took slightly more than a week. But overall, worth the price. "
Material is soft. Feels Like polyester cotton but it does not absorb sweat. It looks nice. I weigh 52 kg . Bra size 32 b . I brought S . The size is okay. For the price I pay I think it is quite worth 
Great quality - soft and lightweight enough. Haven’t tried but can’t wait to use it! Armholes are on the bigger side - am usual UK8 but I took S and fits fine.
Cool comfortable top for sports and casual wear.  Quick delivery and good quality. 
Love the cut and fit of this top! It’s a little sheer so get the black!
Material feels alittle weird. Haven’t tried exercising in it. But the style is nice. 
Nice and comfy material. Will buy again. 
"Good material, love it. May buy other colours "
"(Repurchase) love the material! Very soft and silky, nice detailing at the back too. sizing runs big, I’m a AU/UK 10 and S fits me perfectly. "
"Very thin and comfy material, but sleeve holes are too big for me"
Thin and comfortable material. Size is accurate. Product true to picture. 
"Great quality, will buy another one soon. Cutting is quite big, so S fits well. "
Great quality!
Quality is good. Order my size because of the buyers advise that it’s a bit loose. Totally love it and would purchase again in the future.
"Size S was quite big IMO, but the material is extremely comfortable!!!"
Recommended to buy ! Very good material 
top is behind the bra - very soft material. comfy. loose fit. lululemon design. 
Speedy delivery. Item was well received and the material is good.

"Very thin,, "
quality is OK for it's price. Quite slippery when I sweat but also realised there's a hole? 
"It is great to use and quite light as it is thin. Wash it before use as there is the sort of new rubber smell. But otherwise, it is good for its price :)"
The mat is pretty thin Don’t purchase if you mind However it is fine for me  
"Not recommended. Is very slippery, not feasible if you are doing longer workout. "
"ok, can use.. abit thin. I can accept for this price."

"I have received it, but haven't used it yet. It also seems very thin, quality is also not that good and feels uncomfortable when lying on it. But would still give it 3 stars for the price as it's still usable. There is also black marks and pressed marks over some areas."

"For the price paid for, quality is within expectation "
Very good.
the mat is very thin
Products is good. Same as description 
A bit thin but its ok for the price
"Havent used it yet but it comparison to those $15 mat at watson, i think you should spend just a few more dollars for a good quality mat. Its really thin and too soft for high intensity workout.  However, its really light if you are looking for a portable mat"
Item received as described! Very soft. 
Thank you for your understanding.
Material filmsy and slippery 
Look good 
Arrived and as advertised
Serves the purpose..
Material is a bit thin but I’m okay with it so I guess it’s all good.

Fast delivery. Have not tried yet. 
Recieved the yoga mat in a shorter time than expected. Have yet to use it
Thanks seller
Not bad. 
Like the thickness  Surface a little too smooth but still love the cushion feel becoz of the thickness 
"Look okay Hope it can last longer, but i see it easier to get dirty, need to clean everytime while use."
Item damage
The mat is very thin and very light. Need to fold the mat to make it double to use.
Useful for home workout and simple exercises. Product pretty okay. 
"item still considered very good for the price i paid, just that it has the rubber smell but washed it the smell gone, everything is perfectly fine, took 1 week to arrive but still good, overall i think great product, the mat is also very good for me because im 175cm so its long. "
It’s not Super thick and material doesn’t feel as good but I guess it’s worth the price! The Color is cute tho! Delivery considered ok even with CB going on
Very thin. No grip. 
Received in good condition. Delivery quite fast even during circuit breaker period.
Great and Fast Delivery by Seller & Delivery Company.....
Quality was not as good as expected for a $10 product. Material feels thin and cheap
Item received in good condition. Thanks
"Dear sellar and Shopee I'm sooooo sorry , i apologize both of you .i'm at home all the time, but i think deliver man leave out side door i also not check so sorry again. just now only i go and check then i found . I'm so sorry  i make mistake and Thanks so much both of you.I'm really sorry"
"Fast delivery , got stinky smells but overall is worth to buy"
Mat abit too thin than expected 
Not bad ! 
The mat is too light already. Disappointed. 
Useful item
it was comfortable and niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Used it for half a month and it’s starting to wear off alr. Would suggest investing in a better mat if you are intending to use it for quite a while. It is definitely NOT anti slip and the mat will move around. Also it is quite thin
For a quality like that product should definitely be cheaper. It’s super thin but I guess I’ll get used to it. Length is as specified and comes with 2 bands to secure it :)
"quick delivery, nice colour, might purchase again! thanks "
Received items with good condition 
Very think
Good seller. Very fast in delivery and well packaging. Thanks
"Delivery was very fast, worth is considering the amount you pay for it"
Received  in good condition... happy with the purchase....
The edges were dented..
"very poorly made with low quality material and badly cut. we could smell a foul stench from the mat. I recommend others not to buy this mat, unless you want to get scammed with an F grade mat"
Material a bit thin... 
Good quality! However there is a foam smell to it but still sticks to the floor quite well! 
Quite thin! Has a smell after opening. Cheap so definitely worth the price.
mat is rly thin and does not provide much support .. not true to picture
"exact to pic and fast delivery, satisfied with the purchase :) "
Received but the mat is a little thin 
Quite thin compare to the photo 
Received well and quite fast. Yet to try but looks good. Thanks 
"Delivery very fast even is from overseas ,good quality .Colour nice ,will re-order next time "
Pretty good quality 
"super thin, abit defects and have some smell. not as good as i expected."
Same as picture. Waiting longer transit time during this CB period but is worth to waiting. 
very nice and affordable for its price!:)) love it
"Awesome, high quality, strongly recommended. (:  Fast delivery too"
"Item received in good condition, price is affordable too  :)"
fast delivery. material is very thin but can't expect much since its cheap. 
Item arrived in good condition! Love it
"Bought the one in pink, really love the colour!! Wouldn’t mind purchasing again."
Nice colour. The Eva long enough but too thin for me 
Item received in good condition and very happy with it thanks 
"quite good material for the price, bands at the side for easier storage! good buy afterall! shipping not too slow either"
Thickness I think 0.5cm so definitely won’t be able for long use. That’s is the price is cheap 
"Delivery was relatively fast despite the covid situation. Thickness of the mat was okay. However the mat does not stick well to the floor, so it keeps moving around especially if you are jumping on it. And the mat also gets very very slippery when you start sweating on it. "
Thin as described 
Very Light and soft... delivery time for abit long but totally understand due to covid..
"Light weight, nice color~ Cannot expect much for the quality.  Suitable for simple workout "
Quite thin but ok for the price. Thanks seller!
"For the price, can’t complain. But wouldn’t recommend as it’s too thin. Doesn’t really serve a yoga mat purpose "
thinner than expected but it’s worth the price  fast delivery too
"I will give zero star if thats possible. The quality is bad. Can see from the photo, the shape of the foot print is still there after 1 days. The mat easily get scratches after using. "
Item received with thanks 
pretty bad quality honestly.....
material of mat is not good and very thin
"Fast delivery, but there’s some scratches and mark on the mat"
Fast Delivery! Good product. 
Thin but basic use is fine
Item received in good condition but quality just so so......
Received in great condition. But slightly thin. For the price I think it’s hood
"Thanks for the mat, haven't tried but looks good enough. Delivery took a while."
Too thin for some workouts .get what u paid for.............
The Mat quality is not as thick as it shown.
"Placed order pink colour, but after few days seller told me out of stock due to Shopee system error,  asked me change to other colour, so I change to purple colour, the quality so far so good, seller attitude nice, just can’t imagine what I ordered will facing out of stock happened in the future"
"Quick  delivery,  yet to try!  But looks OK to me! "
too thin
"receive the item in good condition, exact item as per posted photo. Fast delivery too."
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood 
Purchased on 26/4 and received on 5/5. Looks a bit thin but acceptable. 
Very very light. Flown away easily. 
"Yoga mat received! Foam padding is very thin though (Ignore the circle marks, i sprayed sanitizer on it)"
Item received in good condition but the delivery take quite sometimes. Overall is ok but abit thin. 
"Took quite long to reach.  Material is thin n light. Paid less than $8 for it,  cannot complain much. "
"Not good it’s very very thin and very flimsy, it is a foam"
wouldn’t say it is non-slip. what you pay is what you get. still acceptable. 
"Item received in good condition, it has a strong pungent smell. "
I’m satisfied with the order as it is good quality for the price and looks like what is advertised.
"The yoga mat turned out to be a bit thin and having strong smell, the quality is expected with this price but seller should have been more responsive. It took me more than 2 weeks to receive the item."
Nice!!!
Item received very fast a d good quality
Too thin and got wrong smell Trying to clean and air for next few days
Item were light . Was rather disappointed with the quality 
Item packed well and delivery was ok 
Good product but my delivery took a long time. Maybe due to current situation 
Item cane quite fast than expected especially during this period. The status on Shopee was still showing it was in transition but it arrived already.
Everything is fine except for delivery is too slow. Yoga Matt suitable for doing light exercise
$9.28 for a super thin material is not worth at all. Please dont buy. 
"yoga mat was so light and thin, would NOT purchase again"
Tore after using for the 2nd time. 
The material is quite thin and it tore on my first use :( 
"is very thin , isn’t like is in the picture at all. "
"The mat is super thin & flimsy, the quality is low to the minimum. Does not look like the picture at all. Regret purchasing it, I believe you can purchase a better quality ones with this price "
item delivered but got this weird smell 
"It's lighter than all the yoga mats that I've used. Quality is not great but if you want something cheap to use for outdoor, this works."
Item well received!!!
"Delivery was not that long, took a week to arrive. The mat is thin but acceptable for the price. Only downside is that the smell is really strong, very strong rubber/plastic smell"
"very cute colour, actually quite light (not so true to pic) love the bands it comes with to stay rolled up! can't wait to use, though definitely avoid if you have pets or long nails, due to price quality. its the thin kind of sponge that dents will stay in or cause rips. works for me, thanks seller!"
Item arrived as per described. Good padding for work outs.Great buy!
Received the item in good condition. Delivery time is acceptable. Tq!
Delivered on time :D 
Good quality but feels like if i do too vigorous exercises it may tear
"Received well with thanks.It took 3weeks after ordered.The quality average, i will buy more if cheaper."
like ABC mat. delivery was slow probably because of covid19. but ok
Nice pink colour as shown on the photo! But there’s a smell so will advice to open it and put it outside
"The mat is very thin, (my finger for comparison)’it took very Long to ship and there are some dents in the mat, it also has a bit of a playmat/chemical smell to it ."
Looks good and light weight. 
"I didnt check the measurements but its not bad. Long for me but its a yoga mat anyways, can still be used. I like that they have the 2 black removable elastic bands at then end. And very lightweight. It does what it does "
Received it and thank you very much! Excited to try it out! :) 
Nice colour. Item as described. Fast shipping.
Not good without the yoga bag
Fast delivery 
It's very light like sponge. Pretty thin and I wont buy again if I seriously want to workout or yoga for a long term 
"Got it on time as prompt, item was as described. Would totally order another one for my family."
Good to use for my exercise 
Mat is of normal quality but price is cheap so it okay. It works just good for this cb!
Delivery took about 2.5 weeks . 
Material is not that good. It’s light and cannot stick to the floor. 
"Felt that the quality was just meh, it wasn’t firm enough to stay put, very light however not sturdy."
Material thinner than expected 
A bit thin... But okay with my purchase. 
was too slippery and thin material 
Quality is not too shabby. Received item earlier than expected.

Very slow delivery. And there is a smell as well. Will have to air it before usage 
"In good condition although a bit thin, expected for 10$"
Very thin. Not worth for money.
Rubber smell very strong and it is very thin. When I received there were few fissure on it. Poor quality.

It’s very tin 
super fast delivery and good quality!! worth the money !!!!
"Recieved in good condition, will recommend my friend to buy. "
"Smells like alphabet mat. Delivery took very long, i had to request for redelivery twice. Need to contact the customer service as well due to delivery keep on failing."
extremely thin and doesn’t have proper grip so it won’t stay on the ground when you exercise. 
mat is so light and thin that it doesnt really stay on the ground.
Ordered on 12/7/19 and I received both mats today on 17/7/19. Delivery was relatively swift within a week from order. The mats were super light and quite thin which is more like Styrofoam. But this is reasonable for the price paid. 
Not as fantastic as I thought but serve the purpose well. Good buy
quite thin but reasonable for the price i paid. pls don’t expect an A* quality if you’re paying this amount. the fact that it’s functionable is already very plausible. thank u seller! 
"Fast delivery , yet to try "
"Receive in good condition,great buy.tnk u so much seller."
Thanks! Great for yoga at home! 
The yoga mat is quite light! Havent used it but thanks seller! 
Good quality yoga mat   Only downside is that it folds a little at the TOP and bottom but other than that really value for money!:) I bought one in green 
"Item received in good condition have yet to try item not sure if quality is good, well packed and delivery was ok. Good priced value"
Product was received quite quickly. Will be good if can be given an option for normal mail at 0 mail cost. Product was average only. It is pretty thin but good thing is it is light and easy to carry around hope it will last for regular use. Hahhahhahaahahha
Slippery and thin and does not provide necessary grip kind of disappointing 
Quite thin as expected... Overall is still OK in good condition. 
Orders received. Looks lighter and thinner than expected. 
"Delivery was quite fast ,, not as thick as expected but overall it's okay for exercising."
Material is quite thin and slippery. Should improve its quality 
"Order well received. You get what you paid, a cheap and basic yoga mat. Functional product for users who don’t mind branding. Very light weight as well. "

Fast delivery. Within 5 days. Quality good.
Items as described..
Printing not very good quality but what’s not pleasing is it does not fit any disposable mask inside . You need to buy a filter to slot in. So I can’t use now until I get a filter 
"Items arrived within 4 days. Good service, quality and value. A bit small and material goes a bit limp after prolonged use. But otherwise a good product with great designs that are quite the conversation starter!"
A little too broad but overall satisfied.Recommended. Thank you seller.

Incomplete instruction on setting up 
Very fast delivery! Great product highly recommended 
Satified with my purchase. Hope to buy from them again soon
Very effective..  Thank you..  
An extra battery was included. Thank you very much! Looking forward to trying the wireless function given the limited space where I'm staying. Thank you! 
Yet to open. Ordered on 23rd (am) & received on 24th (10pm). 
It looks super cute! Delivery service was good. Now I don’t have to worry about hitting things while skipping! 
Product in good condition. Saves space & comes with rope & spare battery. 
Order received!! Thanks a lot seller time to exerciseeee delivery was quite fast
"Order received in good condition. Great purchase, delivery is very fast. "

"Good, excellent delivery.  Thanks for fast delivery. "
Received item quickly. Came with a spare battery as well 
Good for small spaces!
Received item within 2 days. Batteries and screw driver provided.
Very good. Counter works. Comes with an extra battery too
"Fast delivery, product as showed in seller page. Tested, easy to setup and work well."
"working well, tested and think is quite good to have this electronic counter, shipping was fast"
the counter is inaccurate as it counts double but not too bad of a product 
Very fast delivery. Ordered and received the next day. Have not tried using. 
received! and it works well too
"It was quite fast, received 3 days only after I've ordered. Batteries and screwdriver are provided too! Haven't try yet, hope it'll lasts "
Received in good condition. Tried using it and it works well.
As described. Delivery was fast. Easy to setup. All working just fine 
Same as description in picture. OK product
Quick delivery. 
Item as per photo. Very fast delivery and all in good condition. Thank you.
"item came in good condition. good features too - theres jump count, calorie counter and total time spent jumping "
Delivery was very fast. Comes with battery. Overall looks good. Yet to try 
Delivery was fast. Packaging was packed nicely and was well secured. Will try the skipping rope very soon...
Fast delivery. Thanks! 
"This is a pretty cool product to have!!! There is a timer function, a jump counter / jump count down function and many more!"
"Pleasant seller,product was good just that after using the product I think skipping rope is a better option for exercise,feels more legit hahaha"
Good equipment with spare batt and timer. Not sure if cal count accurate.
Fast delivery! Can skip indoor without the rope hitting the ceiling now! Love it!!  
it’s so cool 
"received item in good condition, complete with extra battery easy to assemble and use, light weight as well"
Product arrived in time. Alos came with an extra better. Yet to use the product
"Fast delivery, gd received I gd condition "
Good!  
Money worth! I dont think the calorie counter is accurate but the duration feature is a big plus! It only runs when you’re actually skipping
Received it within few days. there's already a battery inside the skipping rope and given another one extra as well. working well. would recommend this!
Order well received. Instruction manual is easy to understand.
Fast delivery even though it’s circuit breaker. I hope this works well. Have not tried yet.
Speedy delivery within just 2 days. Easy to set-up and looks cool. The ropeless skipping is ingenious and is perfect to use in my tiny apartment!
Delivery is fast and item working well. Good to use for working out in a small space. But reads I don't really understand.
"Product is okay, not complicated to use but delivery is not fast"
"Easy to assemble, use and accurate. Love it! "
Fast delivery and item received in a wrapped box. Have used it immediately and the count is very accurate.
Received items in good packaging. Came with spare battery too. Will definitely patronise this vendor again. 
Received the product quite fast during mco period . Yet to use but quality seems okay 
Comes with an extra battery and little screwdriver for battery compartment. Easy to operate. Just opened it today so I don't know how long it will last but I am hopeful! The weighted balls are fairly light. I would like them a little bit heavier but this still works for me. 
Works ok. However the calories counter seems to be inaccurate.
Been using my smart skipping rope for 2 weeks now. Effective in counting calories. Recommended 
Easy to setup and working well. Except it came without screws initially as shown and it felt loose so I have to take the screw from the other handle to make it secure. now each side only has 1 screw. Do check! Otherwise so far so good. 
received fast . set up was easy. haven start using yet . good buy though 
Great for what it is! I can finally skip indoors with low ceilings. Comes with batteries already. The only drawback is that there will be some plastic on plastic friction so it gets squeaky. Apply some vaseline or something similar to stop it from squeaking when it spins. 
Material for handle is good. Have yet to try it but looks promising. Hopefully it works well!
Great product. Although one side is slightly more loose. 
Ordered as frd recommended. Delivery was fast
Great seller. Prompt responses & fast delivery within a week. Love this rope fun for the family with adjustable rope length. Easy to install & comes with a spare battery! It’s brilliant ! Super value for money. 
Delivery quite fast. Item as in pic. Quite light weight hope it's good.
Recieved in good condition. Works well.. weight is light though.
Item came nicely boxed and in working condition. Tried and tested! It worked! Worth the purchase. 
Really good. My new gadget for exercising during this lockdown. 
Received much earlier than estimated receipt date. Thanks.
"Good buy as it does come together with a mini screwdriver and spare battery. With limited space at home to do skipping and burning of our cardio, it gave us the alternative to change and use without the skipping rope.  No more excuse of not doing exercise. "
It really good especially if you aren't able to leave home and you need to do cardio. It does comes with the full-length rope which yo u can replace. Got my cardio done while at home! Looking forward to more skipping sessions!
the order arrived safely this afternoon. all good and cannot wait to try it! thank you very much
Well received 
"Interesting wireless rope design. Good for small spaces, but comes with the long rope too if u want the traditional way. Works well and comes with additional battery."
Came with two batteries and it's working well. Just that it's pretty light and user prefers rope to be heavier. 
"Good product , skipping with small space, comes with two batteries"
Item received in less than a week. True to pictures and as described. Comes with battery in the box.
Simple n easy to use
Really pleased with the item but only giving it 4 stars as it did not come with a spare battery as stated. 
Received in good condition . Thank u seller
Items received as per seller's description; it works. Nice colour too.
Order came really quickly! Happy with the product!! 
Fast delivery and in good condition 
Receive in good condition. 
"Order received within a week. Very pretty, comes with instruction manual in English, screwdriver and extra battery. Have tried and it works! Happy with my purchase! Thanks seller!"
Item as described. Good alternative for small/narrow space for doing jumping rope.
Just arrived on time. Well packed. Its just doesn't seem like on the photo. I haven't try the jumping rope. Hoping it will work out well. 
Thank you for the prompt delivery! Its so compact and light!
Good quality. Thank you.
Gooooood :)
Delivered so quick. I like the color and it comes with an extra battery. I’ll buy one again soon. Thank you! 
Product was well received and works well. Loves the flexibility of attaching/not attaching the string.

Super fast delivery. Skip rope works great just as described 
Fast delivery!  Easy assemble and I really like the colour as well! 
Item arrived so fast!  Ordered yesterday and it came today. Have yet to try. Hope its works. Pretty colour too. 
Received v fast! Given 2 battery one inside the machine and 1 additional given both wireless and wired although 1 felt lighter than other but all is good! 
"It is my second time buying the same item,this is for my gf.I definitely recommend it as it is easy to use and affordable for people who are looking for some fat shedding."
Item was packed carefully and received in good condition. Delivery was also very fast. The calculation of the number of skips is also accurate. Great buy. Thank you! 
The material feels good. With the rope attached the counter is accurate however with the other two balls attachment it tends to turn faster. Therefore number of rounds are inaccurate. Overall satisfactory. 
Delivery damn fast. I can’t even take a few days to be lazy 
Took a while to figure out how to install. It’s simple Though. Prefer the wired mode . Good purchase!
Buying as a Christmas present. Thank you seller for being very responsive. 
Well recieevd item in good condition. Tried and needs abit of getting used to.

"Considerably fast delivery, received the item in good condition. Comes in a nice bag. Item is of good quality, and it’s worth the money. Seller recommended!"
Been trying a few days. Helps to stretch my neck. Can use too long if not will be numb. Hope it helps with my neck aches. 
"Ok, comfortable to use.  Best use when lying on the floor using the door knob as support.  "
"Feels sturdy. When I lie on it I don't actually feel it really doing anything, but when I get off, then ya I feel a difference there was a night I couldn't sleep cos my neck was so tense and uncomfortable. After lying on the hammock for 10min, the tension was gone and I fell asleep immediately. "
"Recieved in good condition and works well,  feels quality too"
No difference to my neck. Maybe i'm using it wrongly. 
"Received in good condition, husband said it quite comfortable when laying on it"
Came with a bag to contain the items. Instructions on how to set-up the hammock is included. Hope that it will help to relieve the tension in the neck in the long run. 
Recieved in good condition. Yet to try. Hope it works. 
The rubber band has elasticity to support the weight...tried it on and it is working and safe
Received after 9 days. The material of the items were really good and sturdy
Good Condition  
Good quality product even though not too sure how effective it is. Tried it out. Feels ok. Thanks 
Still figuring how best to use it with the most effect
Quite good to use

"Fast delivery, received in good condition."

"Well received. Have not try out yet, hope it works and able to relieve the neck. "
good product 
Quality acceptable!! 
Material looks sturdy ... yet to try
Just 8 days delivery from China to Singapore! Comes with a thick & sturdy elastic band. Better to pay for a few $ more rather than the flimsy version from other seller. Good inner soft material that holds your head & neck too.  Worthy buy as I heard couple of neck-bones cracking sounds when using.
Quality is good. But does nothing to the neck. 
Just 8 days shipping and delivery quite fast also .And is my 2nd order also. support....
Item received in good condition. Comes with a pouch too. It is quite sturdy and comfortable. Good value for money buy. 
Works well very well if your posture is correct and set the right amount of distance for the bands to extend properly iT stretches the occiput well and provides a good relief. 
VERY FAST SHIPPING TOTAL 7 DAYS REACHED MY HOME. THKS FOR SELLER .
Item came as posted. Well packed. Have not tried yet thou. Hopefully is good 
"havent tried it yet, but material is good and relatively ok price!!"
At least the cable looks solid and reliable  compared to the cheaper version I bought. The elasticity of the cable is important . Thanks seller
Received in good condition. Good quality and really does help stretching the neck area to relief the soreness. :)
Came in good condition and is easy to use

Well received and fast delivery! Great!!
Very special glove.  Put it on and materials  feel good. Fast delivery  too. Thanks 
Received in good condition. My sons are happy. Thank you seller
The L size seems like medium size for this one. The stuff was good but had to ask for refund as it was very tight. Seller has agreed to take it back. The process took its time but got my money back. I would certainly buy again as I bought multiple items from seller and all are good.
good product. received. fast delivery thank you for the deal.
Already describe on my first purchase. Once again the quality is tip top that is why I go again for my 2nd purchase of 2 pairs. Recommended to those cyclist out there to purchase this gloves. 
Fits well but tough to wear/remove. Overall satisfied with it
Ordered on the 4th and received on the 14th. Abit tight on the wrist area. 
Took a long time to arrive. This small size is huge. Material is good.
"Deliver fast and in good condition, but abit of too small. Anyway still usable. Thanks. "
Very comfortable
Nice fit. Quite comfortable. Delivery time reasonable. Thank you 
Dad in law love it perfect size. 
Quality ok. Fitting easier than removing. 1 week delivery to Singapore. Overall happy with purchase. 
Fast delivery. Items in good condition.
Delivery is fast. Material quite good 
Item received. Size fits according to chart as and anti slip is good too. However it would have been more user friendly if the easy to remove tail is a velcro opening / closing.  Overall still happy with it. 
Good packaging. Tried and fit nicely. Good buy.
"The gloves look good, the material is very good, too, just that the delivery took a bit of time, will highly recommend this seller, will buy more from this seller, keep up the good work"
Ordered 2 set of gloves.  Very comfortable. 2 times buying.  Fast delivery too.

good quality gloves for cycling thankyouuu!!!!!!!!!!!
"Recieved in good condition.  A little difficult to wear it but when worn, it is very comfortable. I am going to get two more One size Up.  Recommended. "
"Nice quality products, value for money! Took a while for the parcel to be delivered during this time. Will buy again. Cheers! "
Good quality. Worth buying it.
Gd 
Good quality glove. Hassle free delivery. The material is also good.
"nice material, looks comfortable, value for money"
Comfortable pair of shorts. Inner pair of tights makes the really short length okay. 
"Very comfortable, true to size "
"Uk 8/10, sized up to L, fits well (inner tights not very comfortable though ...)"
Shorts was great a little tight but better than it being loose ! The colour is great ! The inside tights wasn’t as tight as I expected thou. Overall good buy still. 
"Good quality for the price. Would purchase again. Tights inside are just the right length, won’t peak out. Not too short. "
Cutting is not bad but not if the best material imo. Very affordable 
Sizing is great! Fits a size 10 comfortably and arrived quite fast. Will consider buying again.
Comfortable shorts. Not a fan of the cutting. Prefer straight cut. But good pair of shorts
Item received nicely packed! There’s a inner layer to the shorts.. not straight cut 
"Second purchase from seller. Quality is really good, fit is snug. Size up if you prefer a looser fit."
Items took longer than usual to arrive. However the material is really good and comfy! Will purchase again! 
Smooth Quality! And I really love the colour! Definitely will buy again! 
Came exactly as pictured. Really like inner protective layer. M size fits perfectly on my waist BUT personally have fat inner thighs so I would have loved if the inner thigh area is bigger lol but it fits. 1.62m 50kg for reference. 
Came nicely packed. Feels premium and of good quality. Yet to try
Received in good condition. Looks good for working out and wearing at home. Very comfy material.
shorts fit true to size. comes with inner thights with pocket to put phone on the right side. good buy
"Shorts are comfortable and there is a pair of short tights inside, worth esp during flash sale"
"Fast delivery, received before the target delivery date. And, Good product quality. Thanks."
Shorts is a bit baggy but quality is smooth and seems airy! Cheaper option as compared to other sports brand! 
items received in good condition the material is very good and tights is not loose!!
Good pair of shorts for running. Shipping takes about 2-3 weeks usually.
"Quality is ok, but I don't like the tights inside. It will be better if the seller stated that there are tights included."
Double layer protection pants. Material a bit thin. Fast delivery despite from overseas 
"Fast delivery, second purchase. Will buy again if lasting."
Abit loose. But quality is there. Thanks seller
Item well received and seems to be in good condition. Good buy! 
I wear size 28 when I buy jeans and I purchased M for the shorts. it’s a bit too tight.
second buy !!!! very comfortable and in good condition !!!!
"Ordered on 14 May and received in good condition on 28 May. Material is good and the elastic band is stretchy. The imprint in front has a minor error, spelled as “DRYEIT”. Overall it’s ok. I’m usually a UK 10/12 and Size L fits me fine."
I love that it has tights in it so that I won't feel uncomfortable. Thanks seller! 
received the items in good condition! shipping took awhile but seller replied timely with updates :) 
material is better than most product i bought online cutting ok. goods arrive well 
Repeat moving peach purchaser. Shorts are of decent quality. Print says DRYEIT instead of DRYFIT but it doesnt bother me lol
Have yet to try this but material feels great!
"very comfortable exercise shorts! fits me well, for reference i’m 158cm tall and about 50kg. however there’s that typo error lol but not complaining for the price. nice for everyday wear as well."
Fits well for 34 inches hip
size fits really well and quality is good!! would buy again!!
Nice colour! Good quality and value for money. Will repurchase!
"Shorts received in good condition, exactly as pictured. I appreciate that there's a lining inside as the shorts is quite short for my liking (I'm on the conservative side). The tights under the shorts is quite good, doesn't roll up when moving. "
"2nd time buying from Moving Peach and it doesn't disappoint. Good deal, quality is good and the size fits me nicely. Delivery took a while but it's okay since I'm not in a rush. Thank you! Highly recommended. "
"Nice item, came in good quality! "
"really pretty pair of shorts, very comfortable as well. relatively fast shipping"
Really Nice! I love the colours and it fits perfectly! Can’t wait for my 2nd purchase! Thank you seller

Shorts are great! Just the right length and really comfortable. 
Quick delivery and item looks exactly like photos. Great quality at such a low price.  
Good quality!
"Came individually packed. Material feels premium. ""navy blue"" didn't seem too navy but color still nice! "
The yellow is more mustardy than expected. The cut is also Super high. Still cute tho.
bought one size bigger coz review says it runs small. but i still think it’s a little big for me. can consider stick to your original size
Delivery is faster than expected despite circuit breaker. Shorts are just nice for me and I like that it comes with inner tights. 
"Cutting runs small. Got L size but it’s quite tight. But I like the cut, it’s high waisted enough. "
Pretty shorts. With tights inside. Will not worry about showing underwear 
Good quality abit small
"Delivery takes quite long, about 2 weeks. Very pretty piece and good quality. The size is a little on the loose side as compared to other similar pieces of S size, but still snuggly, not for high impact support. Sizing could be standardized instead."
The material is soft and comfy. It’s an aesthetic item. Not much support. Delivery was very prompt. Thank you seller! 
Looks like it could fit me and looks comfortable. Hopefully it is good for support. 
Very happy with the quality and fit of the sports bras! Have yet to try it while working out but so far very impressed by the material and comfort of the sports bra! 
"I wear a 70B and bought a M but I find it a little loose at the armpit area. But it is still very comfortable. The design is nice, and of good material."
Very soft and comfortable. Feels a bit more ‘flimsy’ than the other moving peach bras. But i think it’s still supportive and cute. 
Fits true to size. Don’t need to siZe up. And the back pattern is nice. 
"Repeated buyer here, got it during flash sale looks nice and fits perfectly. I'll come back again for sure. Thank you Moving Peach! "
"Delivery took about a week. Quality is good for the price. Love the design and material, so smooth. Size is alright, usually wear uk 10. Quite stretchable, rose one is slightly bigger than the other 2."
"Fast delivery, design is pretty too. However only using it for light exercise.  This cutting is slightly bigger so M is just nice. Bought L for other design. "
"The front is a little too low. It's fitting, good for low impact workouts. "
"Received in good condition. Acceptable delivery time. Size fits well for bust 75b, 165cm, 54kg.  Will purchase again. Recommended....."
Comfortable material with pretty back straps. Second time buying.
Did not realise the mesh detail on the inner side. Pretty comfy!
Good for low to medium impact sports. 
Bright hot pink sports bra. Size fits nicely. Not too tight. Love the straps.
Haven't try out but the inner part seem very comfortable 
Nice and comfortable! 
good quality! thanks seller for allowing me to change size!! 
Received in good condition. The material is not what i expected but it is still a good buy considering the price i paid for this sports bra and it’s is comfortable to wear.
Love the material and color. Fits nicely. Definitely value for money
material is nice and comfy. colour and design are also pretty though the picture seemed much darker. definitely recommend going one size up from your usual
Fast delivery even though it is by normal mail. Material is good. Will order again. 
I changed the padding. The original one is round and makes me boobies look kinda weird. Otherwise a good sport bra.
"Ordered on 13 May, and finally came today on 24 June. Super long wait, due to the covid situation. Really pretty but support not as good, may not be so suitable for high intense workout. "
Nice sport bra and comfortable. Will buy again. 
Bra not according to size chart. Too big
Nice colour and comfortable material.
Sweet color nice design
Delivery timely. Good material and pretty comfortable. No bad. I took one size larger and good thing it fits.
Good quality.. 3rd purchase
Items received are of good condition and quality. Thanks seller! 
Delivery was slow but understandable due to the covid situation but worth the wait!! 
The colour is exactly what I was expecting !! Super in love with this hot pink sports bra! It’s really comfy and fits me perfectly!
"True to size, fits well. I like it, its nice "
Well recd  3rd purchase Like the material
My second time purchasing this same design. Ordered purple the first time and loved the fit!
"Item received faster than expected. No need to size down, take your usual sizing. This would also be more suitable for Low impact sports"
Good quality and stretchable. Have worn it for jogging and the feel is great!
I love this! Such sweet pink colour!  Material is good and comfy ... stretchable ...size fits well!  Thank you <3
Good material and the size is right. Didn’t expect the material to be so good and comfortable. Will definitely get more in other color and design.
"Good quality and value for money. The size chart was helpful, bought size M which is just right for me. "
Delivery was rather fast and items are comfortable too.... 
The bra is bright pink color and it decolorises heavily!! Wore for one session with a white top and the whole top becomes pink color!!
Well recd Many time purchase  Like their products. Thank you seller
material feels good. fast delivery and received in good condition 
Sexy piece and nice colour! Would buy another piece of light pink.
Very prompt delivery and love the packaging. Pretty product and I love it.
One word Awesome Thank you Shopee and seller Will buy again 
Good fit
Cup size is really small.. this design fr the front not so good compared to others 
Worth the price! 
Very good quality. Repeated buy
delivery takes a bit long.. but not too bad..  quality seems ok.. color is vibrant!
Not the best quality compared to my other Moving Peach tops & sports bras. Still wearable though.
Colour's a little brighter as compared to listing but material feels good 
I always come back to this moving peach. Their quality is good and design very modern. I hope they come out more with many design. 
The quality is very good! Didn't expect it for the price. Very worth the buy. Highly recommend!
"Very good, delivery was ok, like the product, very comfortable "
Delivery took a very long time to arrive. Almost one month. Nice quality shorts but should have got M instead. The bra top turns  out to be nicer than the shorts imo.
"True to size, fits well. The colour is very nice and material is nice too."
Nice sexy back strap.  L is a bit tight for me.  Will get XL next time.
Received my loots and I’m happy about it! Will purchase again
It’s not sweat proof material but it is very comfy! Seller was also nice to help with sizing. Would purchase from them again!! :-) 
Not the first time buying and really love everything! Speedy delivery too
5 stars for product. 1star for delivery. Ordered on 10th received on 29th. Thats abit too long. This bra is suitable for yoga only. Not for HIIT. For small boobies clan can still do hiit with this no issues. Quite true to size. 
"Really soft material.  True to size, i wear a size S for nike & xs for underarmour & size 4/6 for lululemon. "
"Item received as described. Affordable and good material. Although shipping took quite long, about a month, due to coronavirus restrictions, but items are good to use. "
"Good quality and comfortable, 2nd time purchase"
"Love it! It’s a little too long though, I’m at 158cm but stretchy and quality is good too! Will buy again! "
Nice!  Prompt delivery.  Quality not bad.
Great quality and feels really nice to touch. 
"Thanks alot, received in good condition and well packed."
Good quality. Fits perfectly on me. I usually wear medium or large size and this medium size is just perfect.
Super duper love love the material. Very soft & comfortable. Exactly as seen in the pictures 
"Sizing is normal! Am usually a S and this isn’t too tight, fits nicely. Ordered it on 5 May and received on 17 May so it took 12 days despite the pandemic. The colour is also a very nice shade of pink. Thank you! "
"Received the order after a mth, quality is decent for the price paid."
Item came as described. Perfect fit. May purchase again from the seller 
"Fast delivery despite circuit breaker. Cheap and good quality, will buy again!"
"not a good fit, delivery took a long time, will like to request for a refund. "
Supper like the colour n the fabric is comfortable  
Thin and light material. Comes with bra padding. Quite stretchable
Accidentally click received item button. I have not yet received the items. Thanks
True to the image shown. Nice and comfortable. Looks good when worn as well.worth it.
Looks good. Will try it on soon! Thank you for the fast package 
The sports bra is very comfy and the yoga pants is abit stretchy and very comfortable to wear too. Material is good and will order more the next time. 
Material seems okay. Pink is the bright kind. Size seems a bit small but overall okay 
"Received. Very happy with the size, fits very well. Was a little shock by the pinkness hahaha. Thank you. "
Worth it for the price paid for sure!!
comfortable material but might not be suitable for heavy exercises like running but for light exercises should be okay 
Love it..
"Bra fits well, however I dont think it is suitable for high impact sports. "
fits 34C well! good material
Good cutting for the back straps  and comfortable. Order M size.
True to pic. Colour is nice and material is ok.
A little lose for size m. Do not size up. Not enough support. 
"Very nice! I got every colour there is! :)) Size M is just right for me. Not too tight not too lose, just perfect! :))"
Received in 5 days with standard express. Love the back detailing. Very soft and stretchy. Purple is true to pic. Pink is more of a candy colour than the pic in the listing. Fits well but the cups are a bit small for my liking. Not much support. But still loving them in general! 
"Got this piece during flash sales at $8.30 with $1 shipping fee, definitely worth it.  It's more elastic and cheaper lycra feel compared with the the other 2 pieces I bought previously (more expensive), but easier for me to breastfeed my baby."
I usually wear between size S and M (but mostly M) and this size fits well. The quality is pretty good. Overall really good value for money. Delivery took about 1.5 weeks. 
Nice sport bra.Delivered Super Fast.Thank you much Seller 
Comfortable! The sizing is also accurate. Items came well packaged too :)
Quality okay. But feels like will expand after prolong washing
Fits great. Not sure why but all the pieces came with different brand tags. 
"Nice design, colour is true to picture. Super soft and comfortable "
34B and size M fits comfortably :) 
"Nice sweet pink! Material seems to be quite comfortable, cant wait to try"
"Stylish design, comfortable material, reasonable pricing, would buy again if there are more colours "
Good products as usual! Have purchased quite a few items already and their material is a fantastic! Will be back for more again =)
love this top.. very comfy.. well recommended.. fast delivery
The material soft and comfortable to wear  Thank you 
My third purchase Received in good condition...Super fast delivery . Thank you seller
"Looks kinda small to me, will suggest to buy 1 size bigger. Im 165cm tall with A cup. Item received as described. Thank you!"
"Super cute piece, cant wait to wear it! Love the color, love the pretty details at the back. Fast delivery too!!"
"Delivery took 1 week. Item was on offer so okay for the price paid. However, support isn’t GREAT (their other bras have better support from experience). "
Nice colour but more of bright pink instead.. still nice overall
Super worth the price. Took a little while longer to receive but pretty worth it
"Item is really lovely. Wait for flash sales! Saw it being sold at 11.90 at some point, instead ofcthe regular 14 bucks i paid. "
Good material fast delivery although it’s covid-19 now ! The sport bra arrives after 7-9 working days only. Good customer service Highly recommended
Looking good. Long delivery but everything is smooth so far
Nice colour as shown in picture and comfortable. 
Perfectly fit
Ordered 1 size bigger and it fits just nice! Breathable and delivery was very fast.
Nice sport bra.Received in good condition.Fast delivery. Thank you  
Nice and comfy to wear. Just not too fit at the back to show the design flat and nicely. Maybe buy one size small should be better. 
"Fits me perfectly. Super comfy!!!! Obviously cannot use this for high impact exercise, actually it’s so comfy for me that I would use it as a bralette with certain tops rather than for working out since I don’t do yoga  Very pleased with this purchase!"
It’s great! 
Delivery took 1 week. The colour a bit brighter/ more neon than pictured. Was hoping for a more dusty pink. Support not great as compared of their other ranges of bras. Happy with it nonetheless :)
Took about a week to arrive. Responsive seller. Ordered the wrong size and the seller kindly changed it for me before sending out my order. Material feels pretty good.
"Item is as described! Comfortable and good material, favourite among the lot"
Nice quality. Delivery not that fast but total service is ok.
Good quality. Will purchase again !! Recommended to those looking for sports bra ! 
Very fast delivery. the quality is good. The fabric of the pink top is a bit heavy but smooth. hope it last long.
Fast delivery. Material looks gd 
Nice quality but received wrong colour 
Great quality 
Good product!
Quality so so
Material seems quite comfortable and decent. Fast delivery as well
Is not soft pink. It's bright pink. Not my ideal sports bra colour but am lazy to send back for exchange. 
Super quick delivery. The material feels lux and comfy. 
Good quality given the price and fits true to size. Item arrived nicely packed within a week. Would purchase from seller again. 
Good material too :)
"Design is nice, need to see if it lasts."
Received in good condition. 157cm 47kg. Length not too long. Waist band above belly button. Not too tight which i prefer. Overall v happy. Hopefully wont loosen up after few washes. Will update again.
"Comfortable and super stretchy! I think I prefer the material of their compression tights better though. This one is more like those ribbed cotton material, still good but personal preference la. May be short for taller people, I’m 1.55 and this is like 1 inch above my ankles"
"Very soft material, slightly more cottony than buttery but still very comfortable. Flap is not sewn on, making it great for expanding after eating! "
Received the pants in 1 week. Bought during flash sale. Size up to L. Usually wore S size. Can still fit in this L. Nice colour!! 
"Looks more like orange red than pink. And, it is does not have Moving Peach label. Quality is good but looks small. Hope that it fits me well."
"Loving these tights. I am 155cm and 45kg, S size does seem a bit tight when putting it on (yes low-key struggle!) but once on they are super non-restrictive! Tights can stretch as far as I can, no threads snapping etc   No issues with this colour being see through. Some VPL but that's minor. "
"I sized up to L upon reading reviews. L is perfect fit and length. Im 156 cm, around 53 kg, pear shaped figure. Fabric is soft and just the right thickness. I like it very much."
"This is my 3rd purchase and im loving it, will order more!! "
Looks abit thick but quality seems good. Do rmb to wash separately as the color may run
It’s my second time ordering to this store. I like the quality of their garments. Surely will order again! :)
"Looked like grey in the packaging. Only when brought under the light, then able to see it’s dark olive. Overall, love it :)"
"163cm, 48kg, size M is great! Very comfy. Love the dark olive colour and the pockets "
"Material is thicker than the other model of pants and haven’t tried, but it feels like there could be breathability issues. However it’s also very comfortable "
"size a bit small, so better to have a one size bigger but the quality is very good, will order again!"
"Super comfy. Didnt size up, fits well (not too tight/loose) but still heard a few seams rip  knee area is a bit see thru when bent so im sure the butt area would be too. Love the pockets (reaches till almost mid thigh) and the v at the waist. Am a happy buyer"
Pleasantly surprised by the nice fit. Sized up as recommended by most and it was a good decision.
"V comfortable, looks good, and size and length is perfect fit for me as a UK8/163cm. "
Replacement of the wrong size delivered. Delivery is much faster. Material is very soft and comfortable. Fits perfectly. Loving it. Thank you so much seller! 
"Good quality overall. A bit tight for me, cutting seems to be smaller. I bought L size. I especially like the side pockets. "
"The paper tag attached to the size of the pants is misleading as it shows size L whereby the pants is size M. That may have caused the confusion and mistake in sending out the right size. However, seller is helpful and awesome to send the correct size without having to return the wrong one. Thanks! "
"Amazing quality for its price! Fits well, the pocket is deep and the waistband is stretchy. Comes in a nicely packaged ziploc bag too."
"i now own a total of 4 pairs of these! amazing quality and fits really well. for reference im 161cm, 46-47kg, and i bought size m. calf area is slightly loose but overall really good! "
"Love love love it! This legging is thick and super stretchy! Love the structure of the waist band making my waist look super slim!  Gonna buy more colours hehe :) I’m 157cm, 45kg, 25inch waist - Size M fits me well, but I have not tried Size S."
Received in 1 week. 3rd purchase. Love the material n super deep pocket for my phone. 
"Item received in good condition.  Material is real soft, will try and review the fitting again.  Thank you"
Material is comfortable and stretchy but would recommend to size up. 
Good buy! Measurement: 56kg 162cm fit well with size L  Material are comfy soft and stretchable 
Item received in 9 days. All in good order. Thanks seller! 
"I’m 164cm UK 6/8. Bought size L and it fits well. Suits for yoga. If you are putting your mobile in the side pocket for a run, I would suggest you getting size M instead. "
"Fit is snug, im a UK8-10, love the pockets! Thanks, delivery was a lil slow but understandable :)"
Fast delivery and quality is good.. value for money 
"Love the material, my go-to brand and store now for tights and sports bra!"
2nd time order
Item received in good condition. Fits well and but material is thick. Hope not too hot to run in.
"166cm, 56kg, usually wear L for active wear bottoms. L size fits fine, material is great. Material is kinda thick compared to Nike’s so lowkey struggle when you pull up the pants. But otherwise, great purchase. "
very comfy ! recommend! 
The calf area is quite tight. 
The left side is shorter than the right side when worn. 
Love the colour and buttery feel. Fits well and the length is just right. I'm 153cm and 51kg for reference. Nice! 
Material is definitely not buttery soft like how I read it in other comments. But it is definitely soft enough that it doesn’t feel itchy or scratchy on the skin. Made of nylon and spandex. Workmanship is good. Sized up after reading other comments. Not recommended for plus size people.
"Very good quality, can be compared to Vivre active wear but at an affordable price :) "
"Fast delivery. Material is stretchy and comfortable. Length also just nice. Usually an M but bought L cause I read the reviews. I'm a UK 8/size 26, 158cm for reference."
"Dark green in colour, well received. The material is slightly thicker than compression pants material..."
"Fits nicely and the material feels buttery but a little thick! I'm a UK 8, 54kg, 170cm. Size M wraps the body nicely without feeling suffocating  Amazing quality for the price! It has pockets!"
"The delivery took a while. The material is quite soft & I like it that the design is quite basic. From the tags, the clothes seem to come from different sources so the fitting for individual pieces are slightly different, though I ordered them in the same size. But not a biggie to me."
"Good quality, will purchase again. Happy with this purchase"
Received shipment in good condition. 
Received in good condition took less than 2 weeks to be delivered. Size one size up than my usual sizing!!
Very comfortable. Love the material 
Exactly like picture. Bought it for travel purpose so dont mind that it doesnt have the compression feel. I like that it has pockets
"Quite comfortable but of course in terms of breathability wise is not as good as the more expensive brands. But for this price its really bucuo!   For the bra top support might not be suitable for HIIT like high knee, running man, burpees. But suitable for weights workout that are non high cardio.  "
I’m in love! Leggings that are absolutely worth the wait -1.5 weeks which is fast considering covid ! Colour is true to pictures also! 
Sizing is good however delivery is slow but can’t complain cause cb period 
I like the design at the waist. Look Abit short though although I buy one size up. 
"Came in good condition and exact to picture. Quality is good as well.However delivery took super duper long!!! Ordered on 6May and only received it on 28May. I’m 155cm and 47kg, bought size M and it fit just nice. Recommend to size up to your usual size. "
Well received good quality. Second buy. Will recommend!!!
highly recommended !!! thick fabric that is also breathable! hopefully this is gonna motivate me to exercise more :)) 
"I'm 167cm, 53kg and this fits well. The colour and material is really nice and thick enough that u can see through the tights."
Excellent material & cutting  
Super good! Really happy with the model and the material is soft and thick. Im 158cm 48kg and get S size. Fit my body perfectly!
"Very cute and great material, please size up tho"
"Very flattering cutting and fit. Size M fits Lululemon size 4 perfectly. Really comfy too, though material not completely squat proof ( darker colours may not have this issue). Still a great buy for the price i paid ($16.80)! Very satisfied! "
Received in good condition and the material are quite comfy too..will definitely support it again in future. 
Soft and buttery feeling High waisted.  Dark olive is a very nice colour!  L size is ok for UK 8-10 More of yoga tights than sports compression wear
"Fast delivery (esp. during this period), quality of clothing are better than expectation. Comfortable & absorb sweat relatively well. Very satisfy with the purchase, will repurchase agn in the future. "
"delivery took about two weeks, items were all intact and well protected. texture not as lightweight as i would have liked, it’s more towards leggings material. "
Received in good condition. I am 154cm and it fits me nicely. 
"Bought 4pcs, for the price, it is quite affordable and quality was not bad"
"Pros: buttery smooth material and lovely colour and design   Cons: uneven stitches, loose threads, messy seam finish, sizes run smaller (do size up)   Worth buying only if on sale"
Quality is GoooooooooOoOOOoOOOooOoOoOoOoOooOoOoOoOoD
As what everyone said buy a bigger size even though you're are XS in person. I bought M and I still think it's pretty tight till I can't really run cause it's too tight! Not sure how size L will turn out. But I would definitely recommend L for everyone! The yellow colour is nice for a change. 
"The dark olive looks more like a grey color. Love the v cut in front, very flattering on the abs. Stretchable and lightweight, overall a nice purchase! For ref, i’m 1m58 and 52kg and quite meaty at the bottom, L fits just nice."
"Great quality for this price, not sheer, length is just nice for me (158cm). Love the pockets!!"
"Same as photo , nice design and like it . Not really  stretchable , just little .  Thank you "
"Item finally arrived after 2.5 weeks, which was longer than expected despite it being “express”. Pants were a little tight (I have thicker thighs and calves) but it’s stretchable. Material isn’t as smooth as expected, but for the price it’s acceptable."
"This is thicker than the other leggings I bought, not very sure how to wear it out. Consider taking 2 size up cause I only size up 1x but it still feels quite tight  but rmb the bigger size will be longer for sure."
"im 163cm 51kg , usually a size s-m . It fits ! Length fits according to ur size cus it can be adjusted . Material really stretchable and comftable . Can do squats or lift your legs up easily . However one downside is may be able to see underwear lining and not highwaist enough for my liking. "
Item is okay for the price I paid.
"I'm 172cm tall, so the pants is more of a three quarter pants. 26 inch waist. Size M fits well. "
shipping time was decent despite the covid situation and item came securely packed. SUPER LOVE MY NEW BUY! quality is better than i expected and i really love the waistband details and deep side pockets. sizing runs small so remember to size up when ordering!
Second Purchase! I love the fit & it is really comfy. Love the side pockets too! 
"Fits me really well (155cm, 13.5” waist), material not bad considering price, but q disturbed that the length isn’t the same (???) "
Just nice to my height  
Quality feels great! Arrived in good condition 
"Really love this pair! I'm 163cm and 56kg with a relatively round butt and the M fits perfectly. It is so comfortable and so smooth! I love how deep the pockets are, and there are two pockets!!!"
"Delivery took approx 2 weeks. Material is really comfy and the cutting is nice too! For reference, I’m 168cm and 56kg. M fits nicely"
"Delivery took about 1 week, product as described, remember to size up as the material is not stretchy, will purchase again! "
"I love the pockets at the sides, bought this pair for it’s functionality."
really like the yoga suit! very good quality. definitely will buy again!
Very good quality! Highly recommend! fit true to size. 
"A very nice mauve pink! Just that when i was trying it on, heard a few stitches give way"
My favorite pants because of the pocket. Hope to get it cheaper at other colors
Nice! The size is fitting too. I’m 161cm and 48kg. Uk6
Fits really well and the material is so soft and smooth! Highly recommend :) colour looks more like dark grey than olive though! 
"Quality is good, reasonable price "
-delivery took awhile possibly due to the current COVID situation  -seller was very helpful to answer my questions about the fitting  -pants abit tight but love the pockets!
"Shipment was very fast. Tried it on, pretty good material. But haven't wash yet, so don't how it is after several wash."
"bot in my usual size M, highly stretchable and good fit. only downside is it gets translucent when stretched hence when doing squats, it'll be a sight for the person behind you! "
"Delivery took longer than usual this time about 18 days after I placed order, size runs small so do size up!"
I was Glad that I bought a size larger due to the feedbacks. I usually wear M so I got a size L and it fits just alright. Just slightly tight but it’s alright as the the material is stretchy and comfy. 
Nice 
Tights arrived in good condition. Delivery speed was reasonable. 
Items are really comfortable! Provides great support during my workout :)
Size a bit small and not supet stretchy but the pocket design is nice
i love it! repurchased a new set immediately! :) 
Received with good condition and good quality. 
third time getting this for my mum and she really loved the pants a lot !!  thank you 
My second purchase. The material is so good and the fit is just nice. 
Item came in good condition and good quality totally worth buying
Good and comfortable.  Does not seem like will fur up easily. 
Very nice fitting. 2nd time purchase from this seller. Highly recommended
"Ordered on 18 Apr, expected to be delivered by 26 Apr but only received the parcel on 1 May (2 weeks’ wait). Love the colour (very nice shade of olive), cutting and material of the tights! Recommend to size up, am usually a UK8/EUR36/S but took M for this and fits perfectly."
yoga pants are in good quality. Feels comfortable and nice when wearing it. The pockets are the side are very useful. Will purchase again
The quality is good for this price but not the butter soft kind. Nice colour and design too. No camel toe showing too. Perfect length for my height 162.  Not that suitable for hiit or high intensity workout.  I think I'll still go back to my usual premium brands for more breathable ones.
"Not as soft, but these seem to sculpt me a bit better. No Camel toe and is squat-proof. Price keeps increasing. Got at $16.80, it’s $20+ now. Took FOREVER to come 3 weeks+ even though I ordered after the peak of circuit breaker. The one during the peak actually came earlier... "
Stuck to my usual size and it provides a good amount of compression for my workouts. Love the pocket details at the side!   p.s. do ignore the phone case 
Seller is very prompt in replying. Material is good and comfy. Will definitely come back again! *Do size up as other buyers suggested*
"Fits well! I really like the color of this pair, but it does look a bit more grey than olive."
Items recieved promptly and in good condition. Comfortable and smooth material. Seller was responsive too. Have good experience with the purchase and will buy again. Thank you seller!
quality is ok. just wondering why there are 2 different brands. the moving peach brand for the sports bra while a different brand for the leggings. 
def will repurchase! super impressed by the quality :) 
The sizes run small. I can’t fit to the clothes I bought.
"A little tight-fitting, but I'm ok with that since it'll loosen after a few washes. The only downside is that the material is itchy after I started perspiring."
Super nice!!!! Quality is super good considering that item is cheap. Delivery is fast considering the current situation. 
Pants arrived in good condition. Material is thick enough and not see through when doing squats. 
Received the product after more than 2 weeks but it’s understandable due to the movement restriction. Good quality as usual. Will buy again!
Abit loose in fitting overal is ok
Love the material and the design of the pants
Comfortable with its soft material!
really satisfied with the purchase although the delivery took about 3 weeks :) love the material and the perfect fit!
"product is ok although not in moving peach packaging or tag, size m fits 155cm 50kg "
delivery took quite awhile... the material is also not v stretchy. usually wear M but this time ordered L and its still a little tight 
"omg, these tights are down right fabulous! absolutely in love with the colour & design"
Very stretchy and comfortable. I’m usually a size 8-10. The leggings are squat proof too. 
Material is very good. Delivery took abit Long but very satisfied 
The quality is good and worth for the price. Just that M size is a bit tight for me. I am wearing lululemon size 4. 
Not sure about the brand but the material is very soft & comfy. Loving the pockets. Will probably purchase again when I need another pair. 
comfortable piece! Tho feels a little tight I think due to compression! 
Material is quite thick but no VPL can be seen with these tights!
Fast delivery. Quality is ok for the price paid. No other complaints
Love the pants the material is comfortable 
Second time buying this ! this time for my mum and she really loved it ! thank you so much :)
Received packed well. A bit tight but quite comfy. Material seems not bad. Hope it lasts!
I order M size come like a size. Hope u all buy bigger size abit
Good quality. Fast delivery. Will order again in near future. 
Good quality! Love it 
Read other reviews and sized up to large- luckily I did so. Seems good quality. 
Leggings feel comfortable. The rise is a bit too long for more. 
Item received in good condition! Really pleased w the item (:
Material damn good! Fits well too.. will buy again and intro more friends to buy! 
"Nice color. 4 star as it is different from my previous purchased ( Yellow color) .. reason that i bought it as love the first one n now i am still ok but wish it could be the same as the first.. 2nd reason, it shud be longer but isnt.. its shorter compared my 1st ( see photos)"
"Received today in good condition. Delivery took awhile, but still acceptable. Material is quite gd n fitting"
"Exact to picture. Usually size euro 36, got and M and it fits well. Leggings are nice and thick, good quality with sizeable pockets. Seller was really nice to help me change from grey leggings to black! Very happy with purchase."
Took a week to arrive! Havent tried yet but looks comfy. About 3/4 pants for a 1.62m tall person 
received in good condition although slow delivery due to cny. thanks!
"Bought M. Good for me.  I am a usual size XS-S for waist.  Material is stretchable and thin. Can’t compare as good ones cost $50-70. For the price paid, the material is acceptable. "
"Better quality than expected, so I think it’s a good deal and value for money. Olive green looks more like dark grey colour to me though. But it’s acceptable. Comfortable and good for stretching. Love the salmon pink colour. "
Material is pretty decent and fits really really well. Usually a size M but the sizing runs abit small so bought a L. Fits just nice. Love the classic black colour as well. For the price is pretty good quality. However good quality doesn't pass the squat test. Can defo see the inside abit disappoint
Seller recommended S for height 153cm weight 46kg. Fits snugly and reaches full length (might be cropped for a taller person). Dark olive is actually more of grey.
"Really love the pants, going to buy more. Material is really good and stretchy, seller advised on the size and fits great. BEST is there's POCKETS, and they are deep pockets, really functional! Design at waist can cover side fats as well "
After trying the same model for black I love it so much I decided to get the green one too! Somehow the green one seems alot more stretchy and soft! Will definitely come back for more!
Love the olive color! Pants are Super comfy and fit well :) I love the pockets 
Good material and item came within 1 week of ordering. Pockets are also a good feature! Good buy and will recommend. 
Tried it and it fits me perfectly! Very soft and comfy! Thank you:))
Love this especially the pockets. Long enough for me. 161cm in height 
Nice shade of olive green. Love that it also comes with side pockets. Most importantly it is really comfy to wear.
great fitting! as the reviews says size up which i did. im S n bought M n its perfect!! fast delivery!! recommended 
The tights was delivered super quickly !!! loveeee the pocket detail 
Stretchy material and fits well. Reasonable price for this quality. 
"Nice and comfy. But, I find it less stretchy than the other design that I had bought, and it's tighter at the calf area. Due to the stitching/patterns on the pants, have to be careful when pulling up the pants, if not I scare that it might tear. Deep pockets, considering to buy yellow color! "
"Bought S, 156cm, 43kg. Usually wear size 26 for pants, was worried that it will be too small as I read the comments after I purchased it. Turns out alright as it is quite stretchable. And love the pocket too. :) "
"Fits well with a flattering cut, I love the criss cross details and the two pockets for your essentials. My phone fits in there well and I feel like you could go for a run without it flying out haha. Recommended to size up? Size m is good for size 25 waist"
Product is of good quality and came as described. Worth the buy!!
Received item in good condition. Impressed by the delivery speed :)
second purchase! can’t wait to try this piece
Well received. Good material and fast delivery. Will buy it again.
Really pretty colour. It’s closer to grey. Like some sort of greyish green. Comfortable and I absolutely love the pocket!
Another great purchase! 
"Item received in perfect condition, very satisfied with buy. Material is not too thin "
great item. usually a size S but i followed the reviews and got a size up - fits nicely!!
"At first look after opening the package, it looks really small despite me ordering a size M. But it stretches and fits well! Really gives the slimming feel and effect!"
"Ordered a S size which to my horror looked really small when it arrived but after i wore it, the material was pretty elastic as the seller said when I requested for an exchange. However the material is not really sweat absorbant when i did hot yoga. Cant really complain as the price is pretty good. "
Items came nicely packed :) ordered the wrong size & seller was willing to help me change before shipping them out. Colour looks more like grey with a bit of olive green. Still loving it! Thank you!
"Material is great, super comfortable and worth it. Not thin at all when stretched out as long as seamless underwear is worn. The seller also replies fast when I chatted for advise on sizing. Im a usual UK 4-6 and S fits me well. Idk abt M but if you want a looser fit M would work too? "
"Quite impressed!! Though material is thin, it holds really well, is squatproof, and has deep side pockets. Love the grey (dark olive is a misleading name) too! Hope it can last through washes - I’ll confirm repurchase. "
Really nice material. Very smooth and nice to the touch. Having pockets is a plus. Colour is great. Threading is decent. Overall pretty good quality and production for the price. However read one of the reviews proved true is that if you aren't that fit the threading bites into ur flesh n show bumps
Jot as stretchy as I thought so really hard to wear on Thick material  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice material. Recommended to buy L size cause L is already very tight for me (healthy weight) 
2nd purchase of same item.. never regretted it... love the side pocket. as easy n fast putting things in n out.. delivery very fast.. 
Strings were broken when worn. Good material.
Value for money. I purchased one and it was so good that I came back to repurchase 5. Good material. 
Love it! I would purchase again thank you  (sizing runs small)
Parcel took about less than a week to arrive. Product are as per described and shown in the photo. Seller is also very very helpful. will order again! Thank you so much.
Very good quality. Nice fit. Nice material. Repeat customer. All my yoga pants are from this store
Received in good condition.i am of waist 24 and height 151. Size S fits nicely. Recommended!
Good material. Fits nicely. Love that there's pockets too
"Quality is quite nice for the price. A tad too tight around the thighs and calves for me. I wear a standard L for bottoms. overall ok, thick enough."
"164cm and 54kg, not as stretchy thus feel tight. Size up recommended "
Looks good but smells rubbery. Love the pockets and the color. 
"Im a uk 8, 160cm n 50kg. Size M fits well! I think size L might be ok too. Live the material :)"
Sizing runs small so size up when u buy but the material is good. The delivery took abt a week. 
"bought this pair before. S is great for UK6/8, color is great too. fav gym leggings till date :) "
Items were delivered promptly and individually packed and sealed. 
"If I am to be completely frank, the size is a bit small, but material is nice. The pockets are really functional, and the color is very fashionable. I’m docking one star for the price and fit, but otherwise it’s good. "
Item was ok. Item was ok. Hassle free delivery. . . . Fits uk8.
It is very comfortable and of good quality! Pants as shown in picture! 
"Great quality, good cutting & fits a phone. Good value. I like it."
Items received promptly and in good condition. Will repurchase. 
The pant was quite comfortable after trying on. Not as stretchy as I thought it will be.. consider decent quality for the price. Will try wearing for a workout session and will return to purchase if it is good.
Material is pretty good and it’s rly comfy! Thank youuuuuuuu
Very nice colour yoga pants. Not too bright yet not dull. Highly recommended.
"Very nice pair of tights, S fits really snugly and sucks everything in well! Very smooth material. Satisfied with this purchase :)"
Dark olive is more of a muted grey with a slight green tint. Love the fit but not loving the seams/design that runs along the back of the thighs. Areas near seams feels tight during stretching. 
Love the pants especially the front design at the tummy area and best is come with both sode pockets. Adding on a new colour to my workout attire. Thank you seller!
"Material is so soft, although length is a little short. I’m 165 so maybe I should have dozed up a little. But material and stitching looks greatttt! Would def repurchase "
Nice n good my 3rd purchase 
Good quality!  Looks excited like listing~ Color the same  Fits really well~ 
Getting some camel toe action :(( fits me okay (im a size EU 38-40 waist size: 26inch /66cm hip size: 38inch /97cm ) but material quite thin not sure if can withstand much stretching 
Quality is good would recommend sizing up. Very smooth and comfortable
Material is good. Height 155 weight 49kg size S is good for me. I like it fitting. Actual product color appears more light pink
New favourite leggings. Love the deep pockets and high waist. Good quality
Good quality and material. Comfy and worth the buy
Fast delivery recommended seller. 2nd time buying from seller. 
Fast delivery recommended seller. Value for money. Nice fitting too
"A bit tight for me, but I like the deep pockets on these yoga pants"
"Material is comfortable and of good quality, not see thru as well. Definitely value for money. Size S fits well for a UK size 8."
Very comfy and it is high waist to a comfortable level
Of the 3 pieces I bought this is the best fit and quality 
"Very satisfied with the product, especially the pocket feature! 10/10"
Great material. Pockets are deep. Good for keeping your phones when exercising. 
"Exactly as pictured- color and cutting. Super good quality thick material, almost like brand name sportswear. Stretchy and comfortable with good support. My usual is size S/ UK 8. Size S is alright on me. Only one -ve: the seams across  the back of thigh might create a lumpy look."
Very comfy and the pockets at the side can hold a  phone
"awesome quality, really stretchy and soft material"
Material is less stretchy compared to other moving peach items . Should size up 
I am usually S size but I bought M and it’s still too small? Did I get sent the wrong size?
Good quality pants. The size fits quite nicely for 165cm. It reaches the ankle area and can put phone. 
Yoga pants kind of material. Fits well. Pockets on both side
"Great quality, definitely worth every single penny "
2nd purchase the pant is nice and soft 
Comfortable fit and good quality material. Accurate sizing as well
Love the material 
Super good quality and recommended to buy!! I love the cutting and material 
Awesome quality 
Good but a bit tight 
Delivered
Good quality & value for money.  I'm a size S and bought one size S & the other size M. Size S is definitely tighter while size M fits nicely as well.
good quality 
Material is smooth and comfy! Great for exercising
good quality
"Item delivered in good condition, loved the design!"
Good fit and quality material. Very recommended :)
It’s really tight fitting but the material is good and worth the price!:)
Very comfortable! Will buy again.
Very comfortable and fitting! Makes you look slimmer with the cutting 
Fits really well! Would purchase again
Very good product!!! Well fitted and value for money with the quality of the product. 
"Super nice material, fits well"
Good quality sizing fits okay 
"Really nice material and nice fitting, shipping was fast too"
Quality not bad but wish it was a little stretchier.
Really mice &so good .will buy again
fast delivery and very good material!! would definitely buy again
Have not tried yet but received it in good condition.
Very comfortable and good quality
Nice n comfy.. Not too thin also.. I surely grab another colour for this
Material are thicker than expected 
A little translucent when I bend over. 
nice material and comfy!!
Received in good condition and tried it immediately. Awesome quality for this price. Super comfy as well
a little too tight on me even though i normally wear a size M 
Good quality material! Delivery was fast too.
Good quality n worth to buy 
"Flexible, comfortable"
Comes with a nice bag and suggested exercises as well. The material seems to be not bad with rubber strips inside to prevent slip 
"Grey= highest resistance pink=mid black=lowest Material is superb, it's just that when I tried it on hips, I didn't feel the resistance I am expecting. Maybe I am too thin? lol. Came with exercise recommendation, which is a plus. Thanks seller!"
"Relatively happy with the bands, just wish the bands were graded from highest to lowest but you can also feel that anyway. Can’t wait to start using them! Came well packaged too. "
Item received in great condition. Delivery is quite fast despite covid situation. Bands are really good quality. So far it has done the job pretty well for me and is effective although it would be nice to have indication of band resistance. Comes in a cute mesh pouch too. 
"Finally it's here! material is actually not too bad, does have the new fabric smell (should go away after sunning it). lightest for me was black, followed by grey and then pink (heaviest). came with an instruction guide on different ways to use the band too, not bad! let's hope it lasts. "
So worth the purchase as the quality is amazing. Also survived a machine wash since I'm a germaphobe I always wipe or wash whatever I buy. Totally recommend. 
Recieve in good condition although delivery took quite awhile. Resistance band quality feels great but have yet to try it out. 
"Not as per description. Feels like grey has the higest resistance, followed by pink then black. Thick and won't slip, but material doesn't seems to worth the price."
Received item very fast. Good quality bands with good amount of resistance! Came with an instruction sheet as well. Only thing is that unable to tell which is of more resistance as all feel the same. 
Resisitance is good and received in good condition. Will recommend
Prompt delivery and well packaged with bubble wrap. Item as described and pictures. Quality is good. 
Cheap and quality resistant bands! Comes with rubbering inside so it will not slip when you sweat. 
Fitting not good. Leg opening has excess hole while thigh is tighter
"The material is very stretchy and comfortable, definitely not compression tights. "
A bit short but Its ok
Good quality and nice fit. 
Good quality Good colour
material is good for the price paid! 
Pretty good quality.  Stretchy.  Good resistance
"Took a while to receive item. Nicely packed in a pouch, and colours are per advertisement. Feels like good quality, and hopefully the stretchy feel will last for a while."
"Ordered on 18/06 & arrived on 24/06, super fast! Rlly good quality for it's price + will definitely repurchase should this one wear out. The highest resistance for mine was grey and lowest was black. Will see myself using pink the most till I can move up to a higher resistance. Highly recommended!"
Good one!!
great colour and texture
The black band a bit too loose in my opinion. Mostly use the pink one. But good buy. Happy with the purchase!
Pretty good! But the black one feels lighter than the gray? Overall good though. Bands are super thick 
"The resistance level listed on the listing vs actual product resistance is different. Black is lightest, followed by grey, then pink is heaviest. Small issue, can easily tell the difference when using anyway."
"Received in good condition, quality not bad, packed in a pouch. Looking forward to try. However it doesn't indicate the level of strength. Based on my pulling strength, black is the lightest, grey is medium and pink is the hardest."
Nice quality and delivery was quite on time! Have yet to try :)
Item took quite long to arrive. Resistance from Black is lightest followed by grey then pink. Quality seems alright.  
"Received everything as shown. But the resistance levels were not according to the ones shown. The pink band i received has the most resistance instead of black which has the least. Aside from that, resistance is good with differences in the resistance and quality looks promising too. "
Received my item fast. 
black pouch to keep set..delivery awhile shipped fr overseas
Different from the pic of the page... received no brand... 
Received in good condition. Thumbs up! The bands are tight and will be very useful and comfortable for exercise. Will recommend it. 
The band resistance are not according to the photos but no big deal because you can feel the resistance of the each band on your own!! Really good quality and would definitely purchase again once the set wears out!
Really superb quality bands. Have tried them and they’re perfect! 
Good tension. Some fallouts from the black band but should be ok after washing. The grey band has the most resistance for me instead of the black. 
Items received in good condition. Level of resistance is not the same as stated but it’s no problem at all
Good quality! The rubber inserts really help ensure that they do not rise up.
Received in good condition.. The quality of the bands was good. Have yet to try it out. 
Hvnt try out yet. It is exactly like the pic..  Fast delivery.  
Nice love it thank u so much :)
good quality. comes with small bag and a printed guide. bands no size label so have to ownself remember which is which haha
Quality is as expected! Smells like new bands but it doesn’t matter much as it should go off after a few uses and washes. 
"Delivery was fast. The band is good and comfortable, comes with a back as well as action guide that has care instructions too! It’s SO useful and been enjoying it for a day now! LOVE IT! "
Came faster than expected! 
shipping was quite fast. order on may 22 and received the item on the 30th. i would suggest seller to put an identification on the level of difficulty for each band
"Felt the grey is harder.  Just wonder, can I wash the band ? Never think of when placed the order"
Shipment was very fast. Took about a week. The quality of the bands and the bag it came with were very good. 
Came in good quality! But the resistance of the bands are not according to the listing. Black is the lightest for mine and grey is the heaviest. 
Order at 6 Jun and receive on 12 Jun. The grey one was the hardest while the black was the easiest. Overall the band is great. Just the colour to intensity is wrong which is no big issue to begin with. Can feel the intensity differences.
"Delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  Good quality. Reasonable for its price. Bought one piece from another seller at almost half of the price of this set, But its too big on me. Hence I purchase another set, surprisingly its exactly the same quality less the tag.hope they put a resistance tag"
good resistance and material. so much more comfortable than latex bands. 
Came in good condition came with instructions of how to use and what exercises to use them for if you’re new to using the resistance band
Items received with good condition
Nice quality! Love it
"Item came in good condition. Love the pouch and the little info booklet. I can’t really tell the difference in resistance between the grey and pink tho, would be better if they label the resistance "
"Hope this gonna be good use, and able to receive by before phase 2, gonna try soon. Thanks"
The band never state which is light medium hard level
"Bands seem to be of high quality, however there's no indication of the resistance levels on the bands."
Well packed and responsible delivery service! Comfortable product to use.Thank you 
Ordered on 18 May  Received on 28 May. Well packaged - comes with instruction  I’m happy with the purchased  Thank you seller 
Thank you seller. Good quality.. Fast delivery
"Received bands in good condition. Bands are of a good elastic and wide. However, mine didn’t come with a manual."
"Although the band work fine, the design of band is different what was advertised and also bands all have the same size so its difficult to tell the difference in resistivity of each band "
"Nice bands. Should've been better if level of resistance is printed on each band, cos I can't tell which one has higher resistance at first glance. But overall the product is good."
Received in good order. Thanks 
Looks good!! Arrived quickly and worth the money! I like it alot
Received in good condition and it works well 
"Pricier than rubber resistance bands but worth it because it’s cloth & non slip material! High quality, the workmanship is really good so I don’t think it will tear. Even if tear wont be as painful as rubber ones"
Thanks......................................................
very very good quality!!!! ...........................
Good quality and it also comes with a storage bag! 
"good material - as advertised; and absolutely did not anticipate the item will arrive that soon since current situation, i actually thought delivery will be delayed. happy with purchase and definitely will buy again from seller!"
"received well. super sturdy, no loose strings etc, the bands came with a bag. super worth!"
Comfortable and easy to use
Comes in a black mesh bag. The grey stripes on the inside of each band are made of rubber which helps prevent it from slipping. Getting all three gives a good range of resistance for different difficulty levels. Very worth it!
Good deal
"the pink is a little less pastel than in the pics, but quality is great, resistance is good too, i can alr see myself getting a good workout in using these"
"Good quality, fabric material so it doesn't move around unlike rubber resistance bands. Came with a bag."
Good havent tried but there is difference in resistance definitely 
Took a while to receive the item but understandable since it is shipped from overseas. Quality of product is good. Motivated to exercise :)
very good and shipping was fast even during this period of time. would recommend. 
"Delivery was quite fast, less than a week? Expected it to be longer! Products are as per photos, satisfied with the bands."
"I am obsessed love it. Delivery took awhile, shipped from China. There is rubber synthetic smell; had to sun it for awhile. Other than that great item. "
Received box dented but the product is still working 
"Nice product, no defects. Packing is not steady, box crumpled during delivery.. Hope the quality lasts.."
Fast delivery. Have not try yet. Looks good and worth the price.

"Ordered 6 Jun, received 13 Jun. Material is thin Looks feel okay Sizing is just nice for 33-34” waist ."
Received in gd condition. Material was comfortable. Price was affordable too. Will buy more in future.
Ordered delivery reasonably quickly and in excellent condition. Pants were comfortable and bought 2nd time. 
Got XL. I'm 174cm tall and 78kg. My waist is 34 and XL is tight. Those similar with my stat are preferred to take XXL. Thank you.
Perfect!
They fit really well! Fabulous material.
"Quality consider good  for this price.  Lower 2 size down  to S if base on chart my usual is L if you want the compression. My height is 172, wt 68"
Got 1 size below the recommended based on reviews and it still fits. Feels more like a sports tights rather than compression too. May buy another with 2 sizes below recommended to try.
Hey there thanks for sending the order over so fast. It feels comfy and the material is good. Thank you once again for the great help
Item as described. Fast delivery from Korea.

Fast delivery good quality my 2nd order from the seller. 
"Ordered delivered fairly quickly. Material was good, sizing is good. Tried it and it was very comfortable.  Will recommend. "
Came in the mail today! Delivery took ard 2 weeks? Bought it for my brother. Hope he likes it!! Thank u!!
"I got 1 size smaller than what the chart recommended. Fits well, and they're actually quite stretchable. Works fine as sports tights, can't really say much as compression pants. Maybe my expectation of these as compared to another ""2XX"" brand is different. Oh well."
Material is not as thick as expected. 
"Took awhile to receive. Material not bad (Korea). 175cm 62kg waist 30in. Ordered one size down (M) instead of (L). Not enough compression, more like fitness underwear. For compression needs, please use your own judgement. This is US sizing, not Asian. May purchase another one for compression. "
Quality of material is very good. Seller very quick to response to all queries. Will buy again from seller. 
Items as described. Thanks seller!
"Second time buying from the same seller, this time I received faster than before. Product quality is good, that's why I ordered again."

Very comfortable to wear and material is good!
Received in good condition. Material feels good.  Will try it on later.
Bought a size smaller just to be safe. Thankfully for that as it’s just alright. 
"i am 168 and 59kg, M fits fine but i think an S would be a better fit if you need compression support "
"Didn't expect fast delivery during this pandemic period, but it's fast delivery. Good material, happy with it. Now, ordering black color for me and my wife as well."
I’m so buying again

Fast delivery. A little bit too big so compression is not felt.
Good quality product.
"Delivery was quick despite the pandemic. I’m 179cm & 61kg and size S fits just nice. Would prefer it to be tighter. For skinny guys, might want to reconsider. "
"Excellent quality. Compared to my earlier Decathaon base layer, this one is really light and comfortable ideal for tropical locations. Definitely getting other color options. L fits 30in-31in waist (172cm/ 73kg), fits perfect. If your legs not muscular them you may want to consider M for a bit"

Received items in good condition delivered by Ninja Van & It's worth it.
"Ideal quality for thighs, very comfortable, good compression. Tried for speed runs and it is comfortable with little restriction to performance, have yet to try for long distances."
Item received with no issue
It is pretty good value for money if that’s what you are looking for - functional and it serves its purpose - could be a better fit and I chose one size smaller than that recommended so you may need to apply the sizing chart with slight discretion. Happy with the relatively fast delivery.
Decent quality n nice size fit.  Great value for the pricing.

Received and tried .. my hubby like it very much .. help to relieve muscle pain  cheap and good 
Item delivered quite fast although the box was abit damaged. Tested product and working. Recommended  
Awesome. So light yet so effective. Arrived early
Well received although box abit dented. The motor is strong even at 1. Like it. 
Item receieved in good working condition!
Yet to try.looks good.in working condition
recommended! The box was quite in bad shape but the item inside is ok. Use wise super easy and really works. 
I REQUESTED FOR EU PLUG. but came the US instead And seller said that they only have the 2 pin. Quite a bummer. Otherwise It’s really quite sturdy. Worth the price. Strength can be compared to the Phoenix at half the price. 
"Came well-padded and arrived in working order. Tried it immediately for a good 5 mins. Vibration is strong - adjustable 6 speed. Attachments are easy to take out and fix. Manual is English, a big plus. All in, a good deal."
Gun massager came as described. Good packaging with bubble wraps and fast Delivery. Have yet to tried the gun massager. 
"I bought three in total via separate purchases. First couldn't charge the battery, but can work with the charger; I requested for a partial refund and the seller refunded. The second is working well. The third is slightly weak at level 1 massage strength compared with the second. "
"Definitely worth the price! Helps to release tension, relieve soreness and increases mobility. Solidly built with 4 changeable heads. There are 6 intensity levels to choose from. Charger will turn green when it is fully charged. Thanks!"
It is great for aches and the adjustments have a good range. Happy for the proce paid.
I order black colour but recieved Grey colour.. chat with them but no reply attended.. 
Very disappointed. It spolit after using for 3 days. The inner screw came out and do not know how to fix it. 
All good. Comfortable.
Value for money purchase 
Wrapped in bubble wrap. Yet to try but looks good. 
Worth the purchase
"Abit heavy on the gun side. But I hope that it works, will try it after exercising "
The massage gun is good and affordable. Good buy!
OK not bad
Naise
Works well. Helps to relieve aches
Thanks for the delivery and staff 
really good. totally helps on my aching calves
Prompt delivery. Yet to try. 
Second purchase!! Love it so much I have been introducing to my family and friends 
Second purchase for family member. Good buy!
Item arrived fast. The different heads and different speeds makes it good for massaging different areas. Very satisfied. 
Received in good condition. 2nd purchase. 
Very worth item to purchase. 
"This massager are quite powerful.. it comes with different tips, to target different areas. Delivery took around 1 week "
Item came in really good condition. Worth the price!  fast delivery too
Came as described.  Works well.  Value for money.  Wrapped with bubble wrap. 
Well packed!! I am excited to try the product. Charging now. Good that there is EU plug. Hopefully the product works well.
Dented box. But item is ok. So I will forgive.
Massage gun is very good! Black color looks expensive
Good investment for massage . 
So far so gd
super fast delivery (arrived in less than 2 weeks) and well functioning. 
Well received and I'm very satisfied with my purchase!  It's a bit heavy but not too heavy to use. Well packed and so so nice! Fast delivery as well
Quality is very good very solid and fast delivery
It was awesome we love it
"Item received in good condition, seller will bubble wrap to wrap the box and there is no dent. Delivery took quite a while but its acceptable given this covid situation. Tested out the product and it works fine, there are six different intensity to choose from. Great product with the price paid. "
Looks good. Pressure is pretty good as well. Wireless and convenient
Manual came in Chinese instead of English. 
Product was as advertised and works well. Thank you! 
"Used for 1 day and now unable to charge. No indication of charging at all, even after 3 hours in the socket. It's either the charger or the battery issue. Should be a defective item for this case. Contacted seller and no response. White elephant. Not happy. "
Works well and arrived in good condition. Needs to charge first before use. Thanks. 
Have been using it for a couple of days. So far have not used to the point where the battery will run out in a single session. Like it as a portable wire-free massager. A little heavy due to the built in battery. 
Been using everyday for the past few days. Love it a lot! Easy to use and love that it is wireless when using. Thanks seller!
Receive in good condition. Apparently it cant be charge. Dont know if the charger cable spoilt. But seller its not helpful to do anything about it. Late in all replies
It worked! Recommended! Fast delivery! Ok byeeeeeeeeeeeee
"2 round pin EU plug 100-240Vac input with 8.4Vdc 1A output. Very powerful gun with 6 levels,level 1-3 is good for some body places and my mum.1kg gun.Level 5-6 last about 1hr on full charge.Package is bubble wrapped but exterior box is pressed in after unwrapped but product are all in good condition"
"Received in amazing condition. Feel of the gun is good. Looks well made. Box was bubblewrapped and gun came already charged. It's a little more on the ticklish side and I had to turn it all the way up to feel it work my muscles. It's more of quick vibration than ""punches"". No complaints so far. "
"Received item as described - massage gun comes with 4 attachment heads and a charger. Tried it out and the pressure was strong, even at just 2. Do note that it may get a bit heavy for some people to hold for more than 10min. Overall, still a great deal for the price and its functionality!"
Very good massage gun. Working well and is very comfortable. Worth the price. Get yours now.
Quite heavy but worth it
Received item... came with layers of bubble wrap to ensure item is safe whilst on delivery but box was still dented. However i dun mind cos item really works well...! tried n luv it...! 
Item received in excellent condition. Strong vibration and handy!
"Receives in good condition, well packed. Looking forwaes to try it out. "
Item received in gd condition. Hv yet to try.
Works well and as per description
Much cheaper then others but the machine was heavy and noisy to use it until lockdwn over was a good way to save up. Maybe when unlock no more need go msg centre liao use this tool better haha
Looks legit. Going to try charging it to see how long the battery can last
Finally arrived and it's a good product to use for every member of the family. It can feel heavy after holding it for some time (if you're massaging yourself) so best to use it by propping your knees up and resting your elbows on the knees while holding the massage gun to your shoulders. 
Item received in good condition. Bubble wrap. Thank you seller...
"This is the cheaper version of the LED one that I bought from another seller. It's not too bad although you have to press the button at the back x5 times to switch it off. To me, this isnt as strong as the LED one but for 1/2 the price, I think it's reasonable. "
Came well packaged and works well too! Delivery was smooth and quick
"The body is much lighter (compared to $500 Hypervolt gun). It has some rough edges, The internal chip can be seen from the back But Honestly it’s a really worth it fascial gun for $30. Its level 3 is same as level 1 of HV.   *edit: 3rd time using and smoke came out :( dangerous and won’t use anymore"
"Received in good condition, working well. The massage modes are great."
Received within 10 days after ordering. Package came in bubble wrap & good condition. Worked as described. Recommended. 
Alot bigger than i expected. Quality looks awesome. Gonna learn how to properly use it. 
Worth for it’s price. Vibration strong but not sure if it’s that useful for loosening muscle knots..
"Pros: There are 6 levels of vibrations, for the different heads, definitely one till suit your needs. Cons: this thing is 3kg? Super heavy to hold and carry esp if you try to use it for your own shoulders and neck. Only 1 button, aft using, press 5 times to go thru vibration lvls to off "
"yes it's very heavy but the weight helps in pressing down. very powerful, I only use level 1"
Packaging was damaged during shipment 
Item received... What you see in the photo  Is what you will get...
Useful product 
"Works well. Does not really “knead” your muscles, but “slaps/hits” it instead. Still provides good relief though. "
"Delivery took quite long, however, appreciate delivery man still able to deliver during circuit breaker. The gun is quite heavy but dun mind it for a fraction of price compared with the real gun massager sold in retail shops. Love it! Can't wait to use with the rest of family."
This is my 2nd purchase. Total I've purchased 3 sets. I felt this 2nd batch is slightly more lighter then the 1st one. But it works as of now. Good job!
Fun to use after a workout 
"Well Received. Have tried to turn it on and message, It's working great. Thank you "
Tested good but when received scratches. 
"Worth the $ if only for massage purpose. If you need something similar to Chiropractic usage, this is definitely not for you. "
"Can still be use but there are some scratches on the handle, the package looks like just came back from a war."
"Wonderful, really helps. Worth money. Suitable for Kids and adults."
Received in good packaging and looks sturdy comes wd other prts to
Great deal and buy! Delivery is much faster than I had expected. Item was nicely wrapped up with bubble wrap.
Item was packed properly and received in good condition and it worked well too! Seller was good and definitely a good thing to purchase!! :)
Item received good condition . Working well
Solid product - works as it should!
quality good. and working fine
"It’s not lightweight at all, quite heavy, holding it longer hand feeling sore. Comes with 4 applicators, the result so far is soso.. not so comfy as I expected. For the price paid, I will rate 4 stars."
"Love it, The quality is good. "
Worth the buy 
"Looks decent out of the box, have yet to try the product but looks worth for the amount you pay"
Well received!

Good buy! A little noisy and heavy. But works! 
Reasonable n good product

Not useful as machine is not handy Delivery was too much latev  packing was also not good box was broken
Fast delivery. Get the parcel within a week. Manual is in the box. Overall is good
Hope that the product is new as it was very dusty on the inside of the box. Rubber grip on product is a little loose as well. Ball head has a hole in it. But overall for the price it works well.
Take about 2 weeks. Consider quite fast since shipped fro china
Good product. I have very sore and tight muscles and this helps to loosen the knots. But it is pretty heavy to hold
So far so good
Goods well received and works just fine
Received in good condition.. fast delivery too. The power all woking well. Thank you  
"It’s functioning well. Accessories are intact. Box is not dented, well wrapped in bubble bag. The massager is way too heavy for anyone to carry >5min. Cannot be considered light weight."
Packaging very good. Item working good. Good buy overall. 
"Item works well, however it was dirty inside the box. There was white specs of dust over everything."
"Product came as advertised, really effective although its definitely lower grade compared to original. But still works perfectly to massage general nondeep muscles"
The gun was excellently packaged. Well bubble wrapped. The equipment did the work and it was a great investment.
"Best buy ever! I'm a big guy, and this gun performs excellently well will my thick muscles!  Definitely will give it high praises. No need to buy those expensive ones, trust me! This will do just fine!  It has 6 speeds, but the 3rd speed is more than enough to satisfy. This is my first gun purchase."
This is way better then my uPamper Mini... good buy
Fast delivery. Item comes in box. Item is working properly.  
Nice product!
"Super good, I give 5 star"
Good product. Recommended. 
Shioks and does its job. Heavy so i get my husband to help me with my lower back :)

"Item as described, works very well for the price. Highly recommended. "
Good and high quality product. 
Very good. Hit the spot that i want.
Waited quite awhile for it to arrive due to the virus but seller is very nice to update when asked. Came securely packed with bubble wrap. Overall good product. However would advise to clean the heads before using as my friend had an allergic reaction due to dust or whatever.
Order received but gun very heavy.
Received the order in a timely manner. Good product for a nice massage
Delivery was fast and item works well. Abit too heavy though.
"Nicely packed,prompt seller who kept me informed about shipping delays due to COVID outbreak.. Great product at this price , perfectly works. "
Received item in good condition. It is easy to use. Good to be used to relief soreness.
Very well package with plenty of bubble wrap. Very fast delivery too. My only concern is it is a US plug which needs a travel adapter. Other than than everything is great! 4 detachable heads to choose from. 
it is worth the money and relieves my muscle aches..a must buy!
Fast delivery. Cams protected in bubble wrap and works wonderfully! 
Best purchase ever!
Good vibration!
Good and works well! Will recommend
"Received item in good condition, yet to test the item, fast delivery even in this situation, good job well done."
It does a vibrating action instead of pounding action
Battery description 3 hrs. Manuel said 60- 90 min. Actual only 30 Min. Do not know whether faulty battery. Seller refused to follow up. Dishonesty seller
Came in good condition. 
Item are good and tested OK arrived in good order. Regards
Repeated purchase as I like the material and quality . The design is very nice. 
Item was well packed when received. Very good quality. Fast delivery. Thank you seller. 
Reached me all in order. Wow the material is nice! Got design. Recommended seller
Overall quite acceptable at this price range! Quality wise is average too
Tio small again even i ordered XL . I will reordered this time 2XL size
Now finally fits for me.
"this is my second order , buyer  is friendly. The cloth material very good and cooling . i will order again for others color. "
Item is too small for me  i did not catch thats.
"If u are XL is very tight fitting.  Best order XXL for comfort.   To note: Wash separately, because colour runs... Photo and product received looks similar, with label brands attached.  Feels quite good quality.   Received after 9 days, China to Singapore."
"Order on 07 Jul revved on 15 Jul from CN to Sg, fast delivery, suggest to order 1 size bigger and should fit well. thanks seller."
Too small rebuy again this time ordered XL
Fast delivery and good material. 2nd time purchase as I tried 1 time to test and is good. ... Hence I buy again...  Thanks seller.
2nd time to buy.  Quality is really good.
Good and fast 
"Quality is good, only size is a tad smaller. Need to up 1 size if you have a tummy. Overall good packaging and happy with purchase."
Cutting too small
Loving my shirt I bought! Biggest size and it fits me well! Definitely buy again from this place! 
"The T-shirt is heavy and a bit narrow at the armpit area. For the price, cannot expect quality like authentic UA product. Disappointed that Seller shipped the wrong model but not willing to refund full amount nor accept a return. Stuck with a T-shirt that nobody wants."
"fast delivery,feel good to put on.will consider buy another one"
The size for certain models is very different. Twice one of the under armour shirts was too tight even though I got XL. I had to give it to a friend 
3xl is still tight. Received purple instead of red which I originally placed order for. Material soft and nice though.
Quality is ok however sizing is pretty small. Cant fit L size male. Size up maybe two sizes
"Yes, the size is a bit smaller than the usual size, but the quality is excellent. Fast delivery, high-quality products, and reasonable price. I am totally satisfied with my purchase. Probably will buy again. Thanks, seller!"
Its a tight fit T-shirt 
"Item received with good condition. Size is abit small, but overall is good. "
I dont like the quality.. It looks like thights.. 
My second purchase. Product is decent relative to price. T shirt a touch pricey. Hope in future is more variation to the shorts instead black colour and the same material. All the same type don’t know what else to order.
Well received both T-shirts and the material are good. Within 10 days send it to me. 
Fast delivery and quite good quality. Nice packaging.
Fast delivery well done service 
Well prompt update in delivery from J&T express.  Goods received in good condition.   
Very happy w purchase thank you
Recommended to others .. great seller 
Very Nice and perfectly as described..Thank you
"Nice soft material, good buy"
Order received in good condition. Good quality.. 
Quality is quite good but there are some loose threads and stitching. Normally wear L-XL but using 3XL for this. Slightly big but it's a loose fitting that I wanted. 
Super very nice quality    
The Sports T-shirts looks elegant and feel comfort upon wearing on especially during exercise. It can be used for outing too. Nice!
"Received in good condition,  thanks to the very nice seller."
Item received in good order. I'm wear regular Size L. For this purchase I have to upsize to 2XL and it fits nicely.
Got it within a week. Size is just right for me. Satisfactory material quality! 
Fast delivery and well packed.. Worth it! Will buy again.. Strongly recommended!!!
Goods received in good condition 
"2nd purchase. Bought one size bigger than before. Fits better than previous M size. Height 1.61, weight 57-58"
Not sure if this is authentic. But quality and material is good. Delivery was fast within a week. 2XL fits 180ht 75kg 
Item well received in good condition packing . Material is good . Size fits well also . Thank you very much 
Size L was a perfect fit for 164 guy on the skinny side. Material seems durable but not sure if will be hot.

"Item recd but the quality not so good, too thin. Thank seller "
Item received in gOod cOnditiOn.. thanks..

Good quality. Value for money. 
"Quality is good. Fitting. If u want loose fit, get a size bigger."
"Item came as described! Well packed too. Material is rather light, great for warm weather!"
My normal size is L. I bought XL but it's abit fitting for me. Unless you have a nice body I'd suggest buying 2 size bigger. 
Good fit. Good quality too  Received about 1 week + .
It could be good if the can mix design for the bundle of 3.
Nice to wear n cheap 2nd purchase already hope to see more design 
Love it rhe quality is good
Items received in good condition and quality is good.Delivery very fast.Thumbs up
Good quality... I will buy again
Usually buy L for shirt. Orders the shirt to be XL since I read the comments it’s smaller. But it’s still quite small. Pants are worth the price 
very nice material
Good quality. Prompt delivery. 
What a great product will definitely get it again if i get the chance 
"Good material, but it's kind of tight fitting"

"Thin material, have to tear the print from each other when unpacking. Size is smaller at 2XL, need to buy bigger."
The quality is good but the seller send me a wrong color
"Ordered 3 different designs at XL size but all came with different measurement. Tried clarifying with the seller however he/she said that this is as according to different design. If thats the case, they should have state on the note for the different measurement for each individual design. "
"First delivery, the item is same as it described, good quality and value for money"
Love it so much... 
So great even got a free gift from supplier.
Good material but I brought too small L is too small for me n will buy again I like it

Sending me the wrong  colour and size. 
" Best buy must buy please don't miss it, once miss it you will regret it in your life. "
"Abit tight, but still acceptable"
Its nice and will buy. But 2xl is tight for me. But its worth it.
"Delivery took some time, when take out the shirt, notice that the black wordings at the back had white spots that looks like mold on it. Also the paper wrap inside the shirt has red colour stain, hope the colour will not come out when wash. Seem like the quality is not so good. "
XxL still too small for me
Well received................
"Tried on good quality, nice design look very much like original. For less than $10 each worth every penny."
"small then usual size, butter buy one size bigger."

All the t shirt fo nice. May order again.
"Delivery took close to 2 weeks. The t-shirt is ok and true to sizing. Material of shorts is very thin, thankfully is dark colour. Overall ok. "
Seems ok some loose thread but still ok
Good quality and luv the shirt. Thank you
Shirt received in good order. Price is affordable as well The only bad point is the size is rather small for a 2XL.
Very good material but the size is smaller. I bought XXL but its more like a XL.
Great product. Value for money. TQ

Very good quality. Thank you!
The size is too small
Received in good condition high quality recommended thanks 
Small and handy. Looks sleekly and slim on the bicycle. The ringing sound also very loud. See video for example.  Good buy !  
Resonable price and good quality. Fast delivery. Recommended. Will definitely buy again. Have loud sound. Nice and discreet design.. love it!! Will buy again for my kids bikes.. thanks!!!!
Got it for $2.36  Ordered: 09/07 5:55pm Checked mail: 20/07 3:55pm
"The bell has a nice ring to it, loud enough for nearby cyclists to hear. Good material with smooth gold plating!"
Item received and tested in good condition..thank you very nice!!!
"I have to change ro a longer screw as the existing one is too short for my bike's handle. I loved the overall look, and the price is reasonable."
"They look great but springs are rather flimsy, lose the tone rather fast. one out of the three bells I bought just didn’t ring properly, another one lost the ring rather fast"
"Received the product within one week. The product was well packaged, and it fitted perfectly on my bicycle!"
Received with thanks. 
Not very loud. From my observation people still look back when i used it. It still works although it’s a bit soft. 
Item received.. Thank u
First time buying from this seller. Nice color and sound. Will buy again if necessary. 
"Beautiful but very flimsy. You will need rubber strip to mount it firmly on the bike, however the ringer is flimsy and always dislodge"
Decent for price. Is quite flimsy and will not sound well when the metal bar out of alignment and touching something.
Item as usual delivery very fast. Thats y i bought the 2nd time.
"Fast delivery, received in less than a week"
Good quality. Legit TWOOC! Sounds good too. Very cheap. 
Item well received about a week plus using standard shipping. Worth the amount paid for. 
"Received quickly, quality is alright, bell sound good. Thanks seller. "
"Item received very fast delivery, but unfortunately cannot fix on my bike. "
Delivery is fast and items come in gd condition
Bell is Not loud enough
"As previous reviews mentioned, the ring is less aggressive than some other bicycle bells. You will need a screwdriver to install on your bike. Really worth the price!"
Very soft clickin sound..tried it a few times outside no one can hear it & give way to u 
Super value at $2+ only. Just arrived today nicely packed with bubble wrap. I installed it immediately onto my bike handle bar. Works well. Exactly what I wanted and needed. Thank you.   
Cheap. But seems fragile and the bell sound is too soft! Not ideal for getting people’s attention.
The bell doesnt fit mountian bike. Too small. Use it for a child Glider instead
Packed nicely. Very fast delivery! Awsome
Nice. But not loud enough
Like it. Nice bell
came well packed n fit nicely on my bike. sounds loud n has a clear ring too. 
Item as described comes in good packaging.  Sound ok not too load or soft 
"Doesn’t work. Even if I tighten the screw, it’s very loose and can’t strike because it keeps turning."
not the best quality. sound not loud enough to steer pedestrian. its not sturdy. will fall apart if kena shake abit.. will not buy again unless its more sturdy
It works! 
Came in a round box. The 'ding' sound of the bell is 'polite' and will not offend anyone. Small in size. Good buy. 
Item received.  Check and it’s working fine and no complain. Reasonable price. 
The ring itself is not very loud.. have to tightening the screw to make it ring. Ok for the price I paid
Item received in good working condition. 
Received and easy to install.. just screw on to handle bar. Sound is ok.. average loudness
yay received my cute little ding ding dong to fit on my bicycle
Received as describe. Thank you seller! 
Delivery and product in order
Nice color. Happy with the purchase. Will buy more in future.
"Rings well, looks good. item came as expected. Highly recommended"
Sounds nice and light weight. Colour is same as pictures. 
Solid item. Works well. Fast delivery. Great purchase
The horn sound is very soft. Nobody can hear except me
fast deliver. well-packed n works well too. good buy. thanks seller! 
Bought 2 for both foldable bikes.  It was meant to replace our previous electronic bell which was dead after not riding for several yrs. Follow up review :  Just realised one of the bell is not working.  Disappointed though seller say will replace if i buy other items. But nothing i need there ...
Cool design! Love it! 
Item receive  in good condition 
Cheap and good. 
"Took some time to reach , maybe because of the current situation . Overall ok , received within 2 weeks . A decent bell for the price paid for ."
Fast delivery and good quality . Yet to try . Value for money.
Nice bell. Came quickly from overseas. Looks good. Good price. Recommended. 
"Asked for a Red bell, got a golden one! No idea if the colour changed during transit or if it was wrongly packed. Anyway, good bell for the kid's bike. "
Quality and service is excellent. I'll buy it again for sure. Will go to their shop and see other things to buy.
Took a while to arrive but considering the circumstances it’s not bad. Seems like a good product. Good value. 
Quite fast delivery. Item in good working condition. Looks quite nice. 
Received fast and in great condition
"Fast delivery, item feel a little flimsy. No light even after charge"
worst bell ever. not even a little sound. highly not recommended 
Nice ring bel. Installed very nice at bicycle handle. Thanks 
Seems good enough for me to put on my bicycle. Shopping wasn't too long so its a win win
It's a small bicycle bell; quality seem ok. 
delivery consider fast.. not yet unpack and try to use.. hopefully items can work well..
Nice and cool looking bell 
Looks okay. It doesn’t suck on wooden floor. Yet to try on other floors. 
Tried it right away.. suction is good and hold well.. more comfortable to do sit up now.
Received in good condition and try on ground and it hold on tight. Going to try out. 
received bery quickly. have set up.. 
"A+ seller, received the item very fast and in good condition.^^ "
Received very quickly and in good condition. Highly recommended.
"It takes abit effort to fit in the cushions. Rmbr to turn while u push in, instead of just pushing it, this would make it easier to go in as holes r meant to fit in tightly. Great buy, the suction is strong. Careful your flooring when releasing the pressure, so that it wont scratch the floor. "

Everything is fine. I hope it's heavier thou. Material tough. Just review picture #2 it doesn't fit well to where it suppose to be. Overall is fine and hope u guys/girls get six pack this month 
Quality not up to expectation.
Nice sit-up bar.. But the foot support hard to force it in.. But it's still good! Ty!

"Delivery was fast. Packaged neatly in carton box. Assembly took about 5 mins, the small pads a bit tight to fit in. Suction works well and stays firm on marble floor. Wifey chose the color but I think it’s cool. Tested it and works like a charm. Watch out Abs! Now going to look out for a yoga mat."
Fast delivery! Haven’t use yet..

bought on the 17th & came the next day. tried it on marble flooring & it works! definitely worth the purchase
Self easy example. Sometimes the leg padding can be a bit hard to insert. So to try to twist and turn to make it go in.  The vacuum works very well on marble floor. I hope this cheap product can last..
Second purchase already. The suction is good and can withstand the weight of the body. Thank you!

Very fast deliver. Order in evening and received it the next day. The device worked for me and I can do the normal usually sit-up on the floor files with no issues... the sponge may be hard to squeeze into the poles and the paint job is a little uneven.
"Fast delivery. Items recieved in good shape. Works well. Just the hole for 2 of the sponge is too small, so have to cut it."
Delivery was fast and received item in gd condition. Cant wait to set up and try it out. Thank you seller. Comes with another complimentary sponge for the metal bar. 
"The suction is good so far, except the installation, the sponge is very hard to put in. Used quite a lot of effort. Other than that, delivery was fast. "

I didn't check whether the product will  work on my parquet floor before i buy. Unfortunately it doesnt work on parquet floor. Here is my work around to fix it if any other ppl having same issue as me. I use big solo tape to cover the gap between the parquet. It works like a charm!!!

Super comfy shorts and I love it! Made the right choice to buy 3 at one go! Totally worth it!
"Fits nicely. I’m a size S or M, depending on cutting, but since it’s a curved cutting, decided to take M and I’m glad I made this decision! S would have been too small."
These are really comfortable! The material is light and quick drying. Came well wrapped and packaged. If you aren't particular about colours then the original (yellow/gold logo) is value for money! If you're particular about colours I recommend the black one with the white logo!
Goood quality at an affordable price! Recommended!
Super fast delivery. Thank you. :)

Fabric doesn’t feel as soft as before but perhaps with washing it will soften.   Well made and fits well. Happy with my purchase! Hi 
Exactly like the picture!!
"Received in brand packaging - professional delivery. Only a little disappointed as the logo placement is quite high - almost midway of the shorts length. Apart from that, quality of fabric material seems good. Will recommend."
"Material is a bit thicker than expected. Maybe fbt has changed material from the last time I bought haha. Also elastic is quite tight, hope it loosens up with use! "

theyre comfy
Bought 1 straight and 1 curve cut. Both received in good condition.. normally wear L for fbt but Suggest sizing up if you are wearing it at home and want it to be more comfy as the waistband can be quite tight.. I am about 160 54kg.
Good quality but the straught cut is preferred

"fast delivery. cons: no box, so one of them is a little bit squashed, but it is still ok, not affecting the quality. Have not used yet"
"NOT waterproof as the seller claims - loses adhesiveness upon contact with water. However, the tape is elastic and allows for good range of movement. "
As good as existing Elastoplast we are using. Thanks

"165cm, 54kg. Ordered XL cus I have huge thighs but abit loose at the waist. Hope the rubber and lining doesn’t loosen too fast. But good product for its price! "

Suggest to size up. Inner tights are rather small. Material is comfortable but I didn’t realise the inner tights are so much longer than the outer shorts until I received it haha..
Item received with free gift from seller. Material is soft and comfortable. Delivery takes a while. Will order again. 
Material is comfortable as soft and sizing are just nice for me with some allowance. Will purchase again!

Material is good. And thanks seller for the free headband..

"Size accurate. Free headband as well. Wuality is good, will rec"
"Good quality, delivery took some time but that’s okay"
Size is accurate. Free headband. Material seems good yet to try
Bought size L and it fits well. I would say you could maaaaaybe size up if you have larger thighs but I feel the elastic will stretch out after awhile so it wouldn't be too bad an issue.
Have not try it yet. But material seems nice...sizing is good too. Love it.
Good quality.   Thank you seller.   Thumbs up  
Nice material and thanks for the free head band

Received in good condition! Bought the largest size for most comfort. It fits super nicely and it's not that short for me. Material feels super nice. Sad that there's no pocket but I guess u don't need anything while exercising.
Received safely via normal SingPost mail. I'm a repeat customer. Love the shorts.
Good product.. recommend

Very fast delivery! Received within a week. Am satisfied with the cutting and quality. 
"Quality not bad, acceptable  size is fit for me 59kg  comfortable  "

Good material. Free hairband. Wished it was longer but ok with tights inside
"One week delivery time. Well packed and come in good condition. Inner lining of shorts is fitting and hugs your skin like tights. Lining longer than mesh shorts layer, can fold it up to be shorter.  Money wise quite valuable for the soft material of shorts"
received in good condition though delivery took some time perhaps due to 1111 sale. 2nd purchase. good product. wished the inner shorts were a little longer. would be great be side pockets were added to the shorts too.
Receive in good condition. Nice with free gift.

Fast delivery...
Just started to use
"Inside is like rubber yoga mat material with strong rubber smell and outer material doesn't seem like neoprene. More like a soft back support than a trimmer, this barely made me sweat! The rubbery material feels super uncomfortable on skin. And they send me L instd of XXL!! This is up to 45"" only!!"
Not that elastic. Overall quality is okay.  Got this rubber smell once you open the package.  
Delivery was on time. The material is good.

Item received in good condition and material seen to be better quality than previous
smells super bad. it’s big enough to fit around my waist but if u do exercise with it it folds up??? don’t waste ur money on this.... the slim cream is quite good though. but the waist trainer is super bad and smell is super disturbing 
satisfied!
My wife love it. Hope it works well and will buy again. Thank you seller 
"Item seems pretty durable unlike my previous. Cream heats up tummy. Do not use too much of it. Cream works or does not, yet to see results. "
Item well packed and received. 
"For sure can use it for run nd other stress secondary support, but I don’t think this will work as described burn/reduce these that nd all.. "
"Fast delivery and the product is in rubber type material. Has a strong rubbery smell at first but just need to hang it for quite some time. Overall, good quality!"
received the item in good condition and trying it... 
Received as per description. 
Delivery is good... But item.is just waste of money...  Nonsense item
Item came in good condition but pretty long. Hope it will last
"Item well received , haven’t tried yet, hopefully it works. Material look good."
Received and fits ok just that it does not stretch at all .. the effect after I tried not as effective as those that can be stretched more .. 
Order well received.  2nd time Ordering. great product. Will order again.  
Looks good. Have not tried. But there’s some rubber smell. Hope will go away after washing. 
"Item received as described. Strong rubber smell. Material is thin and stiff. Not stretchable at all. The velcro is not strong. Even when I pulled till tight, it's still loosen when work out. It is too small to cover the whole tummy area. Not as effective as what i had tried on another band. "
Well received  Yet to try.. 
Received. Yet to try. 
Good product and save money

Great replacement for a wrong order. Thank you for being honest
"Everything was well packaged, Can’t wait to try it, thank you"
Recipt item 15/05/2020 is good condition 
It gives burning sensation when applied. Still to find out if it is effective though
Size were to big. Need to adjust so that it can fit me well. But just nice for my husband to use 
So far okay but cannot strech much more compared the other 1 I had.
Well received and really forces the sweat out effectively. Only downside is a rubber tire smell when open. Need wash a few more times. 
Im glad it came earlier than expected. It does have a strong chemical smells but I’m totally fine by it. It’s a brand new items and it was pack nicely. Good service as I got the right items. Will buy from products from them in the future. 
Item well delivered. Looks good. Yet to try. Hoping it works.
"Good quality, gonna buy again"
Thanks! Got it by today.
"Item received in good condition, good deal with good quality"
Item was received earlier than expected. Yet to try.
TQ
Received in about 10 days from China. Had wrote in to seller to request for an all black one and they acknowledged and obliged but I seem to have received a pink one still. Have yet to try out the cream but the belt itself is very good to use while exercising: it really makes me sweat
Good condition 
Hi shoppee /seller I recieve my parcel already. Thanks. 
Waist trainer belt looks ok. But no elasticity. It does help to sweat off a bit. Overall it was ok.
Item received. 
"Fast delivery around 1 week, received items as described, cream was effectively burning tho idk if it will lose weight. Haha just for fun will order again if I see the results in a month. Thank you!"
Very good! Worth for money.  
Love it! Have tried it too! 
Fits well and makes me sweat like crazy during my workout. Seller included a lavender sachet as well :) 
Bought the goodness set but got the hulk set. But the products overall are ok. The waist band increases sweat production (during exercise) and it also acts as a corset and keeps the back straight (may just be me). I like my purchase despite the mishap. 
There’s strong smell of the rubber 
Item received faster then expected . Thanks 
"item take more than 2 weeks to received, have not try yet...."
I like it thanks to the seller good material!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well received! The inner material is soft rubber so you will definitely break a sweet during work out 
Will try soon!
V slow delivery. Size is small n not strechable at all. Unable to use it.
"Good condition and stretchy, but not big wide enough to cover entire tummy area "
Received in good condition. Hope it will work for me
"Great packaging. Have not tried product. The belt quality feels firms and secure. Cream smells like ""counterpain"" i m ok with smell. Hopefully it works will reviewed if it works wonder. "
Item as in picture 
Received from Ninja van. Slim cream expiry date Aug 2020 and the slim belt size fit mine. Plan to use it during my running to speed up the slimming. Hope it helps :)
"Came in a week. Outside of entire belt is felt material to wrap firmly, inner feels smooth n firm. "
"wow..i like the colour,SOOO COOL n SOOO NICE..thank you very much..can try tomorrow"
perspire a lot but it doesn’t tighten the whole tummy area. you either use it for lower belly or upper belly 
quality is ok but the delivery took 3 weeks but is ok. will purchase if need
havent tried it yet but it looks just like the images given! not a bad product!  
Slow delivery..ordered goddess set but i got hulk set..
"Yoga ball is fairly good. Comes with pump. The elastic band was unlike the pic, rather thin and smaller than usual one that sells in store. "
Yet to try. 
"It is just as in picture , tried it on and fit so nicely . Hopefully it can be a big helping hand for me to lose weight! "
Came with scent 
A lot more smaller than in photos 
Item quality is impressive. Arrive on time.

"Received it, tried it.. Its was awesome..!! "

"Pretty fast shipping, took less than a week. The elastic band is a little dirty but not a big deal. The foam on the handles feels a little cheap but for the price I paid, cannot complain. Add more bands or stand further to increase resistance. "
All items in there. Have yet to try
Good..
Long waiting time but thats abt it product is alrite
Should use metal rings instead of the original metal loops. Metal loops will get pulled apart during exercises and pierce through the fabric.   
Item well-packed and received in good condition

Well received today. Thanks Shopee. 
Commercial or Advertising photos of product conveniently replaced actual items expected. Nothing new. Only the last photo in the photo album for this item resembles the item/product received. Wow.
Item came as described. Hopefully it can last long as material is not so thick and cheap.
Received the resistance band in good conditions! Much better than my previous resistance band with limited movement

Thank you. Item received in good condition but door anchor was missing from the package. 
too only a little long to arrive 
Looks good and comes with an English instruction guide too
"Exactly what you see Is what you get, can’t wait to hit for exercise "
"Tested out the item for a bit before charging, seems good. Vibration is pretty strong.  Manual states that the battery is detachable but I don't see any battery release catch. Manual also does not provide instructions for the various heads, but that's a neglible point for me. "
"Seller was friendly and responsive, product received in good condition and it works well, would recommend it!! "
"Fast delivery: Friday morning ordered, Monday morning received. Great product. Work well. Can reduce my massage money spending in the future. Thank you very much.  1st charge of 6 hours, last for 10 days, average 45 minutes to 1 hour a day.  "
It was ok.  Hv tried for a few times and it works well
Good!:) 
Arrived super fast. Item works well. 
"Good mid priced gun, quieter and more powerful than a $27 version but far less powerful than a premium Hypervolt etc. OK for personal use but you will need to use on full power (30) to match the force from level 1 on a hypervolt. "
"Updated on the item, item received on 3 June and tried that night and discovered defect on the touch screen - power on/off and speed +/-. Contact seller and insists to bring the item down personally. Even had a video as an evidence,hope all will not be in my situation. Bad service.."
Tested it & satisfied. Very good buy with the offer.

"Super efficient, got it within 3days after ordering. Yet to try but looking at the reviews it looks gd"
Fast delivery even under current situation with circuit breaker. Works well just like the description. Thanks!
Well received within 1 week. Great price and high quality massager - comes with many heads to deal with various body parts. Only thing I would ask for is a manual to provide instruction on which head to use on which body parts. 
"Fast delivery, I love it! Have yet to try the machine, will only try it once charged for 6 hours based on the Manuel stated."
Delivered within 2 days of order and supplier was quick to respond! I had some enquiry and they were very helpful and quick to help me out.   Tested the product and it works great! Good buy and its well worth the money!   Product came in good condition.
"Ordered on 7 Jun 20 and pleasantly surprised that it was delivered extremely quickly on 9 Jun 20 morning. Everything was in order. I tested the product straight out of the box and there was at least 90% battery. Just at level 1 was good enough for me, maybe not too used to it yet. Highly recommended"
Timely delivery. Used the product and I am a satisfied customer
Item came incredibly fast. Very impressed with it. The bag that comes with it is sturdy and practical. Highly recommended. 
"Item was delivered in less than 5 days after order was placed. Comes in a box to help store the massage gun and different heads. So far so good, powerful enough to get a deep tissue massage."
Fast shipping and responsive seller. Item received in good condition and in good working condition. Can’t wait to use it to massage my leg.
"Very cool, and it works! Came in a very nice case! Used the scraper head for cellulites! "
There is some kind of noise in when using it. So its not as quiet as mentioned to be
Great product! A++
Using for a while. The panel came off but was able to push back. Strength is sufficient however the noise can get quite loud
Product received in good condition. The vibration is strong enough to ease aches. Recommended! 
"It is big.... and need to check the website at shopee to know how to use it, the manual not so useful, there are 2 rubber parts where im not sure the usage of... got me confused"
Works well 
"Fast delivery (Ordered on weekend, item delivered on tuesday) but delivery agent did not bother to call up/msg my number when there is no one to receive it at my unit,   Slight dent on the outer box but main package is intact. As from pic, theres a air bag placed inside the soft cover case."

Product was powerful and easy to use! Loving it.
Very good built quality! Battery life lasts much longer than I expected.
"Nicely packed in case and product looks like good quality. May be more expensive than other brands but worth it. Tested on lower settings, already very strong. "
So far so good. Its got a 99 lcd level battery scale and 30 level massage strength setting. Noise level is higher than my phoenix massage gun and also the massage strength also seems less intense. Hopefully this gun proves lasting.
Good product. A little heavy but it works. One month warranty and the seller was swift to reply my questions and shipped out item the next day. I received it within 2 days! Fast!

Item well received.  The massage gun works fine

Extreme fast in delivery! Item received as described!

Nice packaging and fast delivery!! Good amount of vibration for massage too! 
"Nice vibration.  Only issue was the round head, personally I was quite disappointed with the quality.   Would be better if the round head was smooth finishing, instead it feels like cheap Styrofoam material and when the device uses the round head, it's significantly louder.   Other heads are good"
Good service and good item. Quiet and strong. Like that it is able to adjusted to precise levels of strength. 
Awesome !
"Fast delivery. Item received in abt 1 week. Item is good and effective just that when set to high speed, its abit noisy. Overall still satisfy with the item. Thank u Seller."
Very happy with the product. Easy to use and is not as noisy as I expected. The massage really helps to relieve some muscle ache. However it would be great if it comes with instructions on how to use it.

Very fast delivery! Trusted seller and very responsive to queries. Good product and good pricing.
"Delivery took longer than expected, check out with free gift that never came. Claimed no more stock. Should let user know the stock level to make it clear."
"I never received the order. Seller contacted me and said that item isn’t available, and asked me to initiate refund from Shopee customer service. I have done that, but I am yet to receive my money back. But, despite all this Shopee app shows order as Completed!"
2nd purchase. Good product. Will order on 12.12 promotion. 
Nicely packaged in bubble filled box. Received item in prestine condition. Thank you for the free gifts too. 
"Waited 4 weeks for them to cancel on me while taking my money and marking the order as complete, then asking me to appeal for refund from Shopee directly. Absolutely horrendous."
Well received but thought there would have been at least a free shaker with purchase. Pls resend if forgotten.
Well received in good condition. 
Fast n nicely packed 
Item was delivered without airbag to protect it. Their standard seem to varies. 
Delivery was fast but the cap doesnt seem to be tight. Some of the powder came out upon initial opening.
"Ordered 3 items, after 5 days only 1 item arrived. The other items received 8 days later! Disappointed!"
Received the product today in good condition. With free t shirt. Thanks to seller.

Fast delivery.... recommended...
"Item came as described, certified authentic too. Definitely recommended."
Pretty quick delivery. In good condition. Bought it during flash deal.
Fast and swift delivery
Fast delivery and item has more than 2 yrs of expiry date. 
Fast delivery very nice to be used during this period to provide extra protection
Seller had alrdy unlisted this item when I last checked my purchase. Not recommended to buy such material via delivery. Item came crease and it was protected by some thin light sponge which doesn't serve the purpose to prevent crease. 
Clear shield and comfortable to wear. Satisfied with purchase. Shipping was slightly slow but not unreasonable :) 
Ordered on 2/6. Arrived on 12/6. Ordered 4 pcs adult and 1 child. However one of the adult face shield is deformed. Informed the seller the moment I found out. Seller apologized and offer a refund for the single item. Quality is just okay considering the cheap price. 
"Receive with proper protection, but the shield have scathing mark. Hope the seller is honesty not sent the defect product to customer. 2.5 star give because the product "
Cannot use. The protection shied is damaged and cannot see clear  The quality is not so good....
Items received in good order. Quality looks alright and compare decently to those that are sold in watsons. Good deal during flash sales. 
Ordered 5pcs and received it today.Delivery is quite fast. Some parts of the face shield crease although it was packed in a bubble wrap. It could have been better if it was place in a box or cardboard to avoid the crease. Overall it is still okay.
Item received. But crumple and quality is just thin plastic and easily can bend.
Ok but 2 of the children shield was bent outward. Quality can be further improved.
Item received in very bad condition. Face shield was folded with scratches and very bad dented. Disappointed. 
Item received but with creases. Very simple build quality. There are cheaper ones with same design. 
"Quality is not very good. alot scratches/dent. even for this cheaper price, i will not buy again. not value for money. if not i am just unlucky and received a lousier one from the batch. "
Got during flash sales. Well packed and all in good shape. Very worth it.
"Good product quality and fast delivery, good price, will buy again when flash deal is on, thanks seller!! "
"Received dented at both sides, better to buy from Shops directly "
Do not buy. Item was folded with scratches all over. Cant even wear it. 
"I am very disappointed. Item received in a very bad condition, folded all for 5 pieces. I thought u will put a carton or something to keep the shield in shape but nothing for it. I also notice some nail marks on the shield surface which make it worst "
"out of two, one of them was delivered damaged and it was quite a long wait but at least now i dont have to go out with a mask! "
"Item received is in poor condition, no bubble wrapped, not recommended "
Thank you for fast delivery.  Received it well.
Thank you very much! The items delivered are in good conditions! 
Ordered on 1June and received on 9June. Face shield received in good condition.  
Well received. Haven't tried yet. Hopefully it's comfortable to wear and serve as additional protection during this period. Thanks seller!  
Fast shipping and received in good condition well before the actual delivery date. Quality is okay for the price.
"Product receive in Good condition and very well packing, Thanks !"
Items received in bubble wraps however still not able to prevent 1 kid’s face shield to be bend. Bend and normal picture taken for comparison. 
Item received in good condition although the delivery took quite awhile to come. 
Face mask received s dented i ordered 2 adults and 2child. However it come in same size (adult size)  too big for child...
Dented badly. Very disappointed 
OK. Quite satisfied. 
Received item but it’s crumpled as shown
Fast delivery. Good product
"Due to way of packing, 2 face shield is bent."
"Item as described , pvc film shield is like the transparency thickness quite thin . Bought during flash deal $1.50 per pc + $1 shipping "
"Quality not very good. Plastic sheet is thin, scratches all over. Shield does not wrap enough to the sides. "
quality could be better. but ok for the price
A practical and useful accessory for my kids. Cannot wait to let them try it on after school. Thanks seller
Recieved in good condition.  Item in bubble wraps and well pack. Thanks seller!
Item was bent and left a mark on both shields.
Bought 4. 2 of the shields were already bent when the parcel was opened. 
"The item is good and usable but it could be better, also theres so many crease because of shipment maybe."
Looks and feel ok.  Have not tried wearing it yet......
"Material is not bad and soft. My usual size is M but just to be on the safe side, I bought L size and I am lucky because the size fits just nice. "
Ordered two S sizes. Longer than usual but very comfortable and reasonable price. Will recommend seller to friends!
Highly recommended if looking for budget sportswear

"have not used yet but is for my parent, seems good, handles not the best quality in the world but seems completely fine"
I ordered yellow and for some reason i received orange. 
Fast delivery. Awesome product. Second purchase.
Delivery was slow but worth the price. Will try skipping soon. 
Haven’t not tried. Not sure whether it’s going to be very painful if I hit myself when using it. 
Pink color is more neon in reality compared to the photo. But no issue!
Worth the buy
Excellent skipping ropes!!! Like it so so so much!!!!!!!!!
Looks ok 
Fast delivery and well packaged! Definitely recommend! :)
came well packaged. quality is what you paid for - plastic part feels cheap but price is low
One of the end tip is missing. But best price for this range of rope compared to other sellers and came pretty quickly too. You'll need wire cutters if you wanna remove ends of the rope if youre short like me. Leaving the ends would tangle the rope. 
quality is good but too long for short ppl
Received and Seems good quality!! Hope it last for a good workout
Item received in good condition and packaging. Everything is true as advertised. Quality is also quite good for this price. Value for money. Thank you seller.
Bought for a friend so I can’t rate it. Pls ignore my review but delivery and packaging is fast and good 
"Order recieved!  haven't use it, will try when i have time.  Thank you reseller. "
Order arrived quite fast considering the COVID situation! High quality rope for its price! I’d be trying it out tomorrow. Looks a bit too Long but I’m sure it’s adjustable! :) 
Definitely not yellow.. But it's ok
"pretty fast delibery beside covid, everything is good as for now  "
item as described. Have not tried it.
Abit difficult to use and late delivery other than tt okay and great seller. 
good for the price
"works well, will need to use a wire cutter to cut to your desired length but overall good :)"
Ordered a blue rope but seller messaged to inform that they were OOS on blue and I then chose red. Easily adjustable length.
Responsive seller. Delivery took 3 weeks because of CB but seller kept me informed. 
Took awhile to reach but overall feels ok. Have yet to try
Basic skipping rope.best part is that u can adjust the length easily to ur preference.
"Adjustable Length, suitable for various heights in my family. "
"The material is a bit thin and hard to skip,additionally it curls by itself when skipping :( But I guess this is worth the price"
Delivery duration was acceptable. Quality and seller's responsive 
Good items
Its light but need to improve on the handle grip... otherwise its awesome product!
Small and compact. I love the vibrant red colour which makes one look so cool! Length of the rope can be adjusted really easily. Definitely a good buy! Thank you! 
"quality is superb for the price paid, have been using it and lovin it! thank you :-) "
Well received! Thanks seller:) 
Great quality really light weight and easy to use!
Order received in good condition so far so good.it packaged well
Item same exact in the picture

Thank you. Items received. Well packed and good to use
Decent ropes. Value for money. 
Order received in good condition.
Works great.  Good value.
Great product. Quality looks good and promising. Will purchase from them again.
The cable broke after I used it for the first time.. 
"It works well. Rope is very Long so can suit different heights, and easy to adjust. Might need wire cutter to trim off excess cable. "
"Valuable product, delivery was faster than expectation. Recommend to purchase!"
It works. Just be careful not to hit yourself with it. It will leave a mark 
It's okay  Quality is so-so but okay for the price.. Can't complain.
"Very good quality skipping rope. Just dun mis-skip, you will feel pain. Haha.."
fast deliver and good quality!
Working well adjustable to suitable length.  
Product is same as advertised and very easy to use. I love it. 
Same as picture. Might need time to get used to the skipping rope.
comes in normal parcel plastic. the product is okay. it’s light and handy.
Fast delivery even during CB period! Able to adjust the length easily. Yeah! Now can skip at home!!
Item received in great condition! Delivery was prompt considering that it was shipped from China. 
Not bad!  Might get all the colours! 
Ok product
Considered a good quality at this price. Its actually very long but can be adjusted. Recommended!
Product is good!
"Bought and received within around one week! Skipping rope is in good packaging and good condition, possible to remove the small cap tip at the end and cut the rope according to the persons height. Bought one for my boyfriend and I during this quarantine! "
Yet to try. Delivery was rather quick considering the current situation. 
Cheap & good quality 
"order took a long time, 14 days to receive "
Thanks came early!! Great deals
Good for its price!! 
Received. Good deal. Quality and paid less than $3. Will consider to buy again.
Will buy again for friends! :)
Okay for it's price. Length can be adjusted. Feels quite light. 
The skipping rope is good but the delivery took quite awhile. 
"Item received as described. Was initially informed my colour of choice was not available so I chose another colour. However, as pleasantly surprised when I received the original colour intended.looking forward to using these soon."
Expected it to be heavier but I guess it’s alright for its price.
Took 3 weeks to arrive.. good quality 
Looks identical to pictures. Yet to try.
Item received in good condition 
Ok to buy it but one off the side It could not turn it. Hope the seller will be noted!!

"Quality looks good, but have bot yet tried the product. Delivery took quite awhile"
Very nice colours. Fast delivery! Item is nicely packed !!!
Tried and tested. Reasonable for the price  It works the way it should be 
Product received in good condition . Think I have to cut the rope as is too Long for me 
thanks for the good quality item and fast delivery :) will consider buying again!
"good quality, easy to use and adjust. highly recommended especially for the price paid "
works well and the quality seems really good for smth from china!
Received the item. right on time . Thank you very much :)
"Received the skipping rope in good condition and fast delivery. Have used this over a couple of days at the gym and it works well. However, the user will need to be careful as it will leave a temporary mark on the skin if it hits against the body. Thank seller for the promotion. "
"The rope was Super Long, I didn’t expect it to be this Long and to me I feel that it is had to skip"
Steel cable jump ropes are better alternative to other materials as it will not kink easily. Cable is thinner than expected but that’s what you get for the price. Value for money! Easy to adjust length too. 
Item received but handlebar was loose. Unable to secure the length that I want. 
Good thing about this skipping ropes are they are easy to adjust the length and easy to keep
"Good material for this price! Length a tad too long, quite hard to cut thru without the correct scissors "
"Product is good, but just wanna to let the seller know that the item have been open before it reach to me. "
A sturdy skipping rope. Very affordable. Highly recommended.
Recipe fast and good thanks 
Looks as it’s stated. Very cheap and good quality for the price.

I ordered a BLUE but recd a black pce. Seller was fast  2offer refund but I need to send wrong item to Shopee Mall at my cost. I reluctantly accept as item is jus $0.99.  I learn I hv 2b careful not 2buy items listed Shopee Mall as I  hv 2send wrong/defect items back to Shopee at my costs. 
Wrong design sent but seller was ok for refund. Not worth the effort to return since its only $0.99. Other than that the product was actually very comfy. Would buy again if on sale and hopefully they get the order right then.
Items received in good condition. Faster than expected delivery date. Thank you

"Terrible. 15mins into my workout, it broke and hit my face. No reply when I asked them about this even though I gave it 5 days. Worst shopper seller out there."
"came missing a black resistance band and a handle, unacceptable.... doesn’t look strong enough at all. i like a refund thanks..."
"Quality of item is extremely bad. Seller is unresponsive despite repeated messages to check on status of delivery. It took about a month to arrive. Extremely bad experience, one of the worst on shopee so far.     Bands smelled bad and Low quality as well. Would not recommend. Feel cheated"
Item took very long to deliver as the seller did not process the order immediately. Seller did not respond to multiple queries on whether item is shipped. Seller only sent the item when I canceled the item.  Item itself works well in the 2 weeks I've been using so far.
Well received as early as expected
Excellent product. Will definitely buy again from this seller
"Quality is so bad, band breaks so easily. "
Received in good condition. Tried and as advertised.
"Very bad customer service. Seller did not provide any updates on the order for 2 weeks despite me leaving several messages. When I submitted cancellation request, seller quickly updated order as shipped and promptly rejected my cancellation request. Very sneaky seller. Item took 1 month to arrive. "
Thank you seller. Delivery was prompt. All items received in good order. Will strongly recommend seller
Okay for the price I guess... Delivery took quite a while. Seller only responded when I request to cancel order. Item as described by seller
"Very slow shipping - takes more than 1 month to get it. Have used it twice, seems legi. Hope can last "
Gotten the set of equipment within 2 weeks due to current situation. All goods received in good condition. Will have to test out the durability.

Received the item very fast and it come as in the picture as well..Quality was good..Seller was quick to response to my purchase..
items received as per advertised. no more no less. no instruction paper provided. minus point
"Poor quality product. The cables look weak, and true enough the black band (one of the stronger ones) snapped on the first day of use. Not recommended at all, please avoid."
Nice product for the price paid. Reasonably fast delivery.
Fast delivery... good product... good for circuit breaker .
Delivery took quite a Long time due to covid. A lot longer than expected. Tried it today and it works very well. Will continue to update. :)

Took a while to ship. No instructions provided. All parts came as stated.
"Very poor quality, i just got this yesterday and 5 minutes into my first workout it snapped. Is held together by zip ties"
"Well received the item with thanks. Fast delivery, yet to try. "
Item received is different from picture .  Grip is different Missing 1 items ( ankle band )  Not recommended 
"Received in good condition, item was to good havent tried yet"
"very bad customer service, items received are broken. handle has alrdy snapped and couldnt be used. The bad provided has a big hole at the bottom..  contacted seller, asking for respond but no replies at all. buy it at ur risk... "
The delivery was fast and the item were correct as described in the link. 
Used them for a week and I’m left with half the bands that came with it ... 
"If I can give zero star, I would. The band just snapped while I using it. Only used a few times. Lousy quality. PLEASE DONT BUY IT!"
Came earlier than expected. Product seems ok have yet to try it
"Took 2 weeks just to ship out, actual shipping took another week so received after a month.  Seller also unresponsive when I messaged him/her.  Quality for product is acceptable for this price and works as advertised."
"Trick to the game is, seller will only ship out the item when you request to cancel and refund. Don't bother dropping the seller messages, you will only be greeted with automated messages. Can't say much of the quality. You pay what you get. "
"The bands seem to be OK, will hope it last and can use until gym open back up. "
Delivery time took longer that expected. Overall product is as described 
Cables were a little short and quality is not good. The cable was dislocated from the hook when used for the first time. 
Stated to arrive some time on the 20th of April. By then it has not been shipped out. Only receive purchase on 2nd May. Seller doesnt respond to my messages too. Wouldn’t recommend to others who needs urgent purchases. Product seems fine in general.
"This was what was delivered, in terms of the accessories.   Only 1 proper handle was delivered. The other ""handle"" was merely the grip.  Will not order again."
One of the yellow dislocate from The hook.  I have to used a cable tie to fixed it back.  Not sure will it last again 
Took quite some time to arrive. Quality okay. Good for stretching. Still play weight feels better. 
"Items received, just like what u see in photo. Overall satisfied with product."
Ordered on 12 April arrived on 4 May.. probably delays due to covid but still pretty long wait. Items ok but dont expect to replace gym equipment. Affordable enough
"Items came in perfect condition, ready to use. What you see is what you get! "
"Seller only responded when I requested to cancel, took quite long to ship but its fine otherwise"
Fast delivery thanks 
Good and sturdy 
Good item worth the price 
Great product 
It snaps after the 1st use. 
Really value for money. Perfect for this covid period
Fast delivery and good quality product. Highly recommended seller.
Bands broke when doing chest flies
Product as true as picture shown
Item received well in packaging... Awesome!
Extremely good quality bands but not all bands are of the same length
"order received in good condition, comes with training guide too"
Great set.
Cheap and best quality.. recommended 
"Seller took forever to ship, never replied, only when I requested to cancel then they reply and ship"
"After 10 days of payment no updates on shipping, when I tried to cancel the order became “shipped”.  Not recommended "
"Took almost a month to received my order, the quality quite worth it. Thinking to order one more set for my sis but worried that will take another month."
"Product as desrcibed, delivery took about 2 weeks. Overall is satisfactory, might not provide sufficient tension for regular lifter but good for volume and recovery."
Yet to try. Hopefully it last. Totally worth the prices. Totally recommend.
"Personally, don’t think the material is that great and it took forever for the shipping out even before delivery commenced. Update: it snapped and the straps are the worst condition ever "
Goods recieved in great shape
Amazing product. So efficient and effective. Great quality and fast shipment!
"Just tried, not bad. "
"Long wait for product. Otherwise, product is good. "
Came quickly and in good condition
"Ordered 08apr and received on 28apr. Delivery quite slow, Hope item can last longer. "
"Decent equipment, and decent delivery time. "
Product is good and cheap.Really easy to use with many exercise. :)
looong wait of 20 days to receive.
This is an awesome product! Really efficient and effective workout and easy to use. 
Quick delivery and in good condition. 
Took about three weeks to arrive. Would be good if the seller is more responsive and put some instructions slip inside.
Nice product. 
I have only received the package today and already 1 of the bands have snapped. I will like a refund for this please.
Cheap and good!!
Item came in good conditions. Thanks.
Item came well packed and all in order. The hooks look and feel flimsy. I had to use the bands without the handles because there is not enough resistance. I coiled around my hands twice to create more resistance.

Receive the product with a bit of scratches.  Want to do exchange cannot but they allow refund. I need to go for a courier service to send it then go to shopee to pay me back the amount for the courier service. If they pre check the product before sending out then save all these. Looks like used.
"Fast shipment, gd product, a little heavy on the weight, but ok"
"6 gears available to choose from. Product working fine so far. Would love it to be a little more powerful. More of superficial massage, not deep tissue."

Surprise that Sunday my item is delivered in good condition and service is excellent.  Tried the product and it serves the purpose well.

"Tried using it to test it out if its working, seems to be working fine. Thanks! Worth the buy"
"Very good, cheap, fast delivery, good service, awesome, one of the cheapest on shopee, buy again"
This is pretty strong but yes a tad noisy. The device is big so small hands will find difficulty in gripping it.
"works as expected. tried the small flat head on my neck and it’s nice has 6pulse rates, needs to press 7times to turn it off as every press increases the pulse rates"
Good value for it's price 
"Received the item within a few days time.    But after a full charge, use it only for 10 - 15 mins time, it stopped immediately.  I think the battery quality is not as good & is too short, not for me!    I don't really recommended it! "

The T shirt seemed to be not cooling material. Need to try as well. Items are well received.
Items received in good condition and delivery was considered fast!
"The colours are beautiful and the material is cooling. However, i’d suggest to go one size bigger. When i put it on, its abit tight around the armpit area. "
So badly wanted to give this 5 stars but too bad. The glasses made was above average was very happy with it but the primary lense were scratched and the clear lenses does fit the frame. So i contacted the seller they were very helpful. They send over new lenses for $2.
Was happy that they send over new lenses but one was wrong colour and the other was a S2 model. Overall experience great but logistics issues and delivery is quick.
Item came early then i expected. Well packed. Happy with the item. Will order again. Can recommend
"Great seller, received item fully complete.. recommended Will order more "

Fast delivery. So far the quality look good.. haven’t try yet. But hopefully it works to burn tummy fats. 
It’s not really suitable for me. It will slide up and down whenever I sweat too much during my workout. I prefer the ones I bought from Watson.

material is not stretchy at all however it does fit me just nice. did sweat alot with it but dont know whether will flatten down my stomach.
"Delivery took quite a while, but reasonable since its from overseas.  Strong rubbery smell. Belt NOT one bit stretchable "
Thank Q... lov it soo much

"Works well. Happy with the product. Note that it doesn’t work on wooden or floor boards. Works well on smooth tiles only, for obvious reasons, like any other auction items. "
"Suction of the sit up bar is very strong, padding of bar is thick, so you can enjoy sit ups with ease. I chose black so that it won’t get dirty. The quality is very good and super easy to install! "
Received in good condition! 
Sturdy product. Works well on flat flooring and has good height adjustability. The product is able to wothstand sunstantial pulling during usage. Can be easily disassrmbled n reassembled again very quickly. Bought the safe black version. Delivery considered to be reasonable considering situation
Love this product! The suction is very strong and it does not move when I do sit up. You can adjust the height by pressing on the button and moving it. 
Works extremely well for me. Good suction. Fast delivery. Will reccomend to others 
The grip is very good and received in good condition. I love it!
