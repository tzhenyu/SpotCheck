5,Soft not bad
5,Thanks to the review by the ladies. Got M for me which is the sport size of S to M.  Good fit. Love the purple color. 
5,Order took abt 10 days to reach me. I usually wear S for tops so this fits well but the straps are a lil tight as I have pretty broad shoulders. Also bit difficult to put on and take off. Maybe I’ll try M next. Love the material.

5,"Ordered on 15th June, received on 23rd June. 4th time purchasing and it is always a pleasant experience. Selected the wrong size and seller was helpful to amend my order. Satisfied thou would have preferred if the inside do not have a separated band. I suppose it gives more support that way anyway."
5,"received in 8 days! usually a Nike sports bra size S/M, I opted M for this based on the measurements provided, and it fits nicely! love that the white color material is good and thick enough, so it is not see through :-)"
5,"Repeated buyer, fits so well and so cheap when bought during flash deal, thank you!!"
4,"Second time buying from moving peach. This time not 100% satisfied with all items. I like the cutting for this. Fit is fine too, just that it comes with weird thick padding and is not so stretchy. I don’t like work out tops that are a struggle to remove. "
5,"Well received! Material is good, thick, stretchy, and opaque! "
5,Quick delivery and item looks exactly like photos. Great quality at such a low price. I would suggest sticking to your usual sizing as L is way larger than any of the other tops.

5,"Good product, really can feel a little sweaty. I have used for three days, still starting from Low to high current. However, right side stronger than left, so abs may turn out lopsided. Other than that, I think must also control diet and workout. This is just an additional measure"
5,as it had stated.

5,Delivery was fast
5,Package in good condition. Have yet to try it but im excited.
5,Box are dented oh why.
5,good buy during flash deal. 
4,"Looks cute & all but back part rides up like some others said, although sizing was right."
5,The padding was thicker than those from other products and fitting around bust could be better 
5,Love the back of the design!!! 
3,"The paddings are too thick and do not mold well especially on white colour, shoulder straps are a bit short, yet underarm hems gap a little... "
5,a good fit and quality material! it is also very comfortable though the cloth is on a thicker side
4,Fast delivery Received as what shown.. but the bra site doesnt fit well on me.. maybe I don’t have big boobs
5,Received in 9 days. Quality is good & comfy. 
5,"Will got another type, well fitted."
5,"Ordered 22nd of November, received on the 16th of June. Very satisfied with the top. "
5,Shipping is fast once it reaches SG
5,"Material is nice and soft, has a built in bra compartment. I like it a lot! "
4,"Quite thick, feels like swimwear "
5,Very good material. Comfortable and sizing is as described. Stretchable. 
5,Good quality.. Thumb up 
4,"Tank top came with removable bra padding, it was on the thicker side and weights a little so I swapped it out. Other than being a low - medium intensity bra tank, this too could easily be a lounge wear/ basic top. "
5,Major love the scoop back top plus the inner padding! 
5,NIce bareback cutting! Could even pair it with nice pants or skirt to head out. Material is thick and sticks nicely to the body when working out. 
5,"Like this very much .167/51kg, M fits me well ! "
5,"M is too big for UK6/8, would suggest getting S instead! So sad it feels so comfy but too big for me :( "
5,love it! size just right
5,Have yet to try but so far quality is good. Comes with a push up cups.
5,Usually an S for sports bras. Not very tight. Makes a better layering top. 
5,"Fast delivery within 1.5 weeks! Quality is really good too, can double up as a camisole and work out top:) For reference, am 48kg, 24” waist and usually an XS/S and S fits perfectly. M would’ve been too loose — like another that I’ve bought. Will recommend!"
5,Soft quality and really nice product overall. Shipping is fast too.
5,Size too small and not expandable 
5,Bought it during flash sale and got 2 diff colours and sizes. I’m usually a uk6/8 . Size M fits me better and size S is more body hugging which I prefer it to be looser. It’s comfy to wear it as a lounge wear at home !
5,Initially thought material would be a little thin and not very good but it's actually nice and sturdy and hugs the body just right! 
5,Sizing fits well and material is decent (not translucent at all). Will definitely order again. 
5,Quality is good. Suitable for Low impact exercises. Could be worn as casual wear too!
5,"Bought this pair of tights for a friend who is UK8, fits perfectly."
5,"Great tops! Can be worn outside as well. Note that the material is stiffer and thicker than usual, so don’t expect it to be as stretchable. But good quality for sure :)"
5,Comfortable 
5,nice! the padding was little too thick for my liking but it is removable. so no issues there. I wear UK6/8- I got a M size - it was just right...maybe a little snug - but still ok. 
3,Not a fan of the inner rubber band but the cut looks pretty 
5,Nice. love the colour n good quality. Wil buy again 
5,Fits well and doesn’t shift while working out! Very comfortable. Highly recommend!
5,"Fits UK6-8, C70-C75. "
5,"LOVE! Honestly was afraid the purple wld be too dull but it complements my skin tone really well ended up the most in love with the purple out of all the tops (they were all great, good cutting, quality material!) (168cm, 59kg, UK6-8, bought M)"
5,Item received well packaged. Normally wear a size S for tops. M for this fits well. 
5,This tank too is very nice. Good padding. Can wear it for workout or just going out. Love it!
5,"sized up cause of bust size, ordered M before but it doesn’t provide good support for bigger bust size. this one fits okay and quite good support, would be great if the strap is adjustable so we can adjust for body length"
5,love the quality! am very happy with it. am probably gonna use my own padding... unsure if i bought one size too small?? but still love it
5,I’m uk 6(?) for TOP and this is slightly big for me but comfortable! Thanks seller :)
5,"Item took a while to arrive, but quality is good and flattery cut. Comfortable to exercise in."
4,Material is comfortable. True to size. Will repurchase when there’s a sale again.
5,"Usually a UK6-8 on top, but even then the top can be a little tight to put on and take off, though the fit is ok once it’s on. Might try to size up next time.k Mok"
3,The size S appears to be very tight even though usually I wear size S for tops. Hopefully it will get looser as I stretch it
5,"fits perfectly! decent price for good quality, very fast delivery. will definitely purchase again!"
5,"Picked size S, equivalent to adidas XS. "
4,Looks nice but straps were a bit too short. Not very comfortable 
5,"Love this, well padded and fits well (usual S, sized up)"
5,Good quality. Happy to receive. Fast delivery also. Thank you seller.
5,Love this - could also use as a top on its own (super comfy and looks good). Removable paddings. Will be buying again in other colours!
5,"straps are a little loose,  nonetheless a good product overall considering the price paid. "
4,Packed individually- as described. Feel the quality is adequate to pricing. Hope it’ll last..
5,So pleased with my purchase. It works as a top for barre or yoga lessons if you prefer. Or even as a top over high-waisted bottoms. 
5,A bit shorter than expected
5,good quality and highly recommended!
5,"Nicely packed, great material but doesn’t fit that well on me though"
5,"relatively quick delivery with correct item in good condition, no dents or damage i could see and was packaged in a few layers of plastic protection! satisfied with product :-) "

5,"Pruchased on 30 May. Delivered on 05 Jun. Tested it. Comfortable and spongy! Good for those who don't want to expose the thights while wearing sport shorts. But not too sure should wear with label facing inwards or outwards. It gets a bit warm for longer distance. Overall, satisfied!"

3,"Ordered on 7/7 and arrived on 15/7, rather fast delivery, really confortable material soft and stretchable however the cup feel and look a bit weird. Not so flattering to wear on its own, cup is too obvious. And not really push up, But good for the price. Longer too than normal sports bra."

5,Item delivered as described.  Fast delivery too.  Recommended 
4,"I like that the product came with a plastic wrap. However, I find the product not effective enough in massaging my back, in my opinion, like it massages a bit but not ""deep"" enough in my muscles. "
5,Came nicely packed and quality looks good. Yet to try. 
5,thanks
5,Fitted nicely
5,Nice item  
5,Took 14 days to reach my letterbox.  Quality looks good but should have got one size larger.  Looks like sports pants inner lining

5,Bought 2 diff sizes because i fall in between. Wore the L/XL. Fits ok but the bottom part keeps rolling up. So might be a little loose for my sizing. Thing S\M will be a good fit. Went for a run with this and it stays put well! Recommended!

4,Not exactly that comfortable for female. Didn’t know it is meant for man as it was not stated in Seller’s description here. Saw some female buyers review thats why I decided to take it in good faith. For normal riding female should not order this model. It feels weird. 
5,Ordered on 17 May and received on 29 May. Item is the same as in picture. Working as advertised. Mesh cloth and comfy to use. Highly recommended! 
5,Items well packed and arrived quite on time about 5 days.very satisfied with the material . Very comfortable to wear and I recommend hand wash so you won’t overstretch and cause looseness of the whole support. Very matching with yoga sports pants. Or you can even match with jacket and jeans or pan
5,Items is very nice satisfied .  But I'm a quite disappointed with wrong sizes that the seller send.  It's my 3rd time purchased 
5,Wow this items I order last week and the shoppe said will deliver about 2 weeks but come early and I'm happy I can wear already.
